# Introduction

In computer science, it is often necessary to determine if a given number is a power of two. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as optimizing algorithms or checking for errors in data transmission. In this challenge, we will write a Python function to determine if a number is a power of two.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

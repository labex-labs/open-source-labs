# Introduction

In Python, we can easily subtract two integers using the '-' operator. However, what if we are not allowed to use this operator? In this challenge, we will explore how to find the difference of two integers without using the '+' or '-' sign.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

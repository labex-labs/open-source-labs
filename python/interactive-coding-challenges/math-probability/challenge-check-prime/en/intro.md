# Introduction

In mathematics, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a prime number is a positive integer that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. In this Python challenge, we will write a program to check if a given number is prime or not.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

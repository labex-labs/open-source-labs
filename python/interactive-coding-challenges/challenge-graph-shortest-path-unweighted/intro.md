# Graph Shortest Path Unweighted

In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized. The problem of finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph can be solved using a breadth-first search algorithm.

# Introduction

In Python, a linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Deleting a node in the middle of a linked list can be a challenging task, especially when we only have access to that node. In this challenge, we will explore how to delete a node in the middle of a linked list, given only access to that node.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Longest Common Subsequence

In computer science, the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

# Introduction

In programming, it is common to encounter problems where we need to find a missing element in a given data structure. In this challenge, we will be given an array of 32 non-negative integers and we need to find an integer that is not present in the input array. The challenge is to solve this problem using minimal memory.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

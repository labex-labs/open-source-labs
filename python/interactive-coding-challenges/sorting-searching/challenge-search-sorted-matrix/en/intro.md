# Introduction

In computer science, a matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. A sorted matrix is a matrix in which the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order. In this challenge, we are given a sorted matrix and we need to search for a specific item in it.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

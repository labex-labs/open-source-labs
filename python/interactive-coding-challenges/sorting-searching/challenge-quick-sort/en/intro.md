Quick Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array or a list. It is a comparison-based algorithm that works by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays, then recursively sorting the sub-arrays. Quick Sort is widely used because of its efficiency and simplicity.

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. It is the process of arranging data in a specific order. Selection sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and putting it at the beginning. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

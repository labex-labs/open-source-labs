# Introduction

In programming, it is often necessary to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as sorting data or searching for specific values. In this challenge, we will focus on merging array B into array A in sorted order.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Introduction

In programming, it is often necessary to manipulate strings. One common task is to reverse a string. This means that the order of the characters in the string is reversed. For example, the string "hello" would become "olleh" when reversed. In this challenge, we will implement a function to reverse a string in-place.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Introduction

A priority queue is a data structure that allows for efficient access to the minimum (or maximum) element in a collection. It is commonly used in algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Huffman coding. In this challenge, we will implement a priority queue backed by an array.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

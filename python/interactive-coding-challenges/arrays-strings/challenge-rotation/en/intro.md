# Introduction

In computer science, string rotation is a process of moving the characters in a string to the left or right. A string rotation of another string is a process of taking a string and moving its characters in a circular fashion. For example, the string "abcde" can be rotated to form the string "cdeab". In this challenge, we are going to determine if a string s1 is a rotation of another string s2.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

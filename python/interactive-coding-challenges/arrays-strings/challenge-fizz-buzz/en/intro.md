# Introduction

Fizz Buzz is a popular programming challenge that is often used in coding interviews. It is a simple game that requires players to take turns counting up from 1, replacing any number that is divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz" and any number that is divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz". If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player must say "FizzBuzz" instead of the number. In this challenge, we will be implementing Fizz Buzz using Python.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Introduction

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. In this challenge, we will implement a hash table with set, get, and remove methods.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

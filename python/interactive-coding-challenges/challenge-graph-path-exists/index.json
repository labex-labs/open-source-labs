  "title": "Graph Path Exists",
  "description": "In computer science, a graph is a collection of nodes that are connected to each other through edges. Graphs are widely used to model real-world scenarios such as social networks, transportation systems, and computer networks. One of the fundamental problems in graph theory is to determine whether there is a path between two nodes in a graph. In this challenge, we will write a Python function to solve this problem.",

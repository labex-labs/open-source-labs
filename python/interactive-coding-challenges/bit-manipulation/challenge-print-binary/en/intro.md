# Introduction

In computer science, binary is a numbering system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1. It is widely used in digital electronics and computer systems. In this challenge, we will write a Python program to print the binary representation of a given real number between 0 and 1.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

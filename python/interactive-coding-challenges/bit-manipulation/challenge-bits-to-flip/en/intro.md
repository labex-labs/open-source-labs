# Introduction

In computer science, bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Bit manipulation is used in cryptography, error detection and correction algorithms, digital signal processing, and many other fields. In this challenge, we will determine the number of bits to flip to convert int a to int b.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

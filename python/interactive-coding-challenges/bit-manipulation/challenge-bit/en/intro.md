# Introduction

Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various fields. It involves manipulating individual bits that make up a binary number. In Python, we can perform common bit manipulation operations such as getting a bit, setting a bit, clearing a bit, and updating a bit. In this challenge, we will implement these operations.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

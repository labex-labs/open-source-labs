# Introduction

In computer graphics, a line is a basic element that can be drawn on a screen. Drawing a line on a screen involves setting the corresponding bits in the screen's memory. In this challenge, we will implement a method that draws a line on a screen given its width and two absolute pixel positions.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

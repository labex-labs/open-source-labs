# Introduction

In this challenge, we will be exploring a problem related to running up steps. We will be using Python to find out how many possible ways there are to run up to the nth step, given that we can take a single, double, or triple step.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

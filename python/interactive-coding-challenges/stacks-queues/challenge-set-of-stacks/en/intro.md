# Introduction

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. In some cases, we may need to implement a set of stacks, where each stack has a limited capacity. When a stack reaches its capacity, a new stack is created to store additional elements. In this challenge, we will implement a SetOfStacks class that wraps a list of stacks, where each stack is bound by a capacity.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Introduction

In computer science, a binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure in which the value of each node in the tree is greater than or equal to any value in its left subtree and less than or equal to any value in its right subtree. In this challenge, we are going to find the in-order successor of a given node in a binary search tree.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

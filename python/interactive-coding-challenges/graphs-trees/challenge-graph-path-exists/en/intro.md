# Introduction

In computer science, a graph is a collection of nodes that are connected to each other through edges. Graphs are widely used to model real-world scenarios such as social networks, transportation systems, and computer networks. One of the fundamental problems in graph theory is to determine whether there is a path between two nodes in a graph. In this challenge, we will write a Python function to solve this problem.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

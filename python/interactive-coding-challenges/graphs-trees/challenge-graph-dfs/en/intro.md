# Introduction

Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes and edges. Depth-first search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In this challenge, we will implement DFS on a directed graph.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

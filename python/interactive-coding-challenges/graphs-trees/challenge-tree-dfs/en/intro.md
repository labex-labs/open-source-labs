# Introduction

Tree traversal is a common operation in computer science and is used to visit each node in a tree exactly once. Depth-first search (DFS) is a popular algorithm for traversing trees and graphs. In this challenge, we will implement DFS on a binary tree.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

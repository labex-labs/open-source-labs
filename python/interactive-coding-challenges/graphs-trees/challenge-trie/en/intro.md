# Introduction

A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store and retrieve a set of strings. It is commonly used in search engines, spell checkers, and IP routers. In a trie, each node represents a character in a string, and the path from the root to a leaf node represents a complete string.

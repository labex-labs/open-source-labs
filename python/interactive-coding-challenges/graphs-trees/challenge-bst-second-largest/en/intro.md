# Introduction

A binary search tree is a data structure that is used to store data in a sorted manner. Each node in the tree has at most two children, and the left child is always less than the parent, while the right child is always greater than the parent. In this challenge, we will be finding the second largest node in a binary search tree.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Introduction

In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of linked nodes. Each node in a tree has a parent node and zero or more child nodes. The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node in the tree. In this challenge, we will determine the height of a binary tree.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

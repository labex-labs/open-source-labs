# Introduction

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A balanced binary tree is a tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. In this challenge, we will write a Python program to check if a binary tree is balanced.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

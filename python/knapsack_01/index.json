    "description": "The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science. It is a problem of combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to select items to maximize the value while keeping the weight within the capacity of the knapsack. This problem is used in many real-world applications, such as resource allocation, portfolio optimization, and cutting stock problems.",

# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Explore memory-efficient ways to store large datasets in Python
- Learn about different ways of representing records including tuples, dictionaries, classes, and named tuples
- Compare memory usage of different data structures

In this exercise, we examine various options for representing data structures with a focus on memory efficiency. Many Python users perform different kinds of data analysis, so understanding the trade-offs between different data structures is valuable knowledge for optimizing your code.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn to explore memory-efficient ways to store large datasets in Python. You'll also discover different ways of representing records, such as tuples, dictionaries, classes, and named tuples.

Moreover, you will compare the memory usage of different data structures. Understanding the trade - offs between these structures is valuable for Python users who perform data analysis, as it helps optimize code.

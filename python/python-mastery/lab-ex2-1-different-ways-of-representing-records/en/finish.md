# Summary

In this lab, you have learned different ways to represent records in Python and analyzed their memory efficiency. First, you understood the basic CSV dataset structure and compared raw text storage methods. Then, you worked with structured data using tuples and implemented five different data structures: tuples, dictionaries, named tuples, regular classes, and classes with **slots**.

Key takeaways include that different data structures offer trade - offs among memory efficiency, readability, and functionality. Python's object overhead has a significant impact on memory usage for large datasets, and the choice of data structure can greatly affect memory consumption. Named tuples and classes with **slots** are good compromises between memory efficiency and code readability. These concepts are valuable for Python developers in data processing, especially when handling large datasets where memory efficiency is crucial.

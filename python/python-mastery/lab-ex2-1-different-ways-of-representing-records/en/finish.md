# Summary

In this lab, you explored different ways to represent records in Python and analyzed their memory efficiency:

1. You started by understanding the basic CSV dataset structure
2. You compared raw text storage methods (single string vs. list of strings)
3. You worked with structured data using tuples
4. You implemented and compared five different data structures:
   - Tuples
   - Dictionaries
   - Named tuples
   - Regular classes
   - Classes with **slots**

Key takeaways:

- Different data structures offer trade-offs between memory efficiency, readability, and functionality
- Python's object overhead significantly impacts memory usage when working with large datasets
- For large datasets, the choice of data structure can make a substantial difference in memory consumption
- Named tuples and classes with **slots** provide good compromises between memory efficiency and code readability

These concepts are valuable for any Python developer working with data processing, especially when dealing with large datasets where memory efficiency becomes critical.

# Comparing Different Data Structures

Python offers several data structures to represent collections of related data. In this step, we'll compare different approaches and their memory usage.

Let's create a new file called `compare_structures.py` in the `/home/labex/project` directory:

```python
# compare_structures.py
import csv
import tracemalloc
from collections import namedtuple

# Define a named tuple for rides data
RideRecord = namedtuple('RideRecord', ['route', 'date', 'daytype', 'rides'])

# Define a class with __slots__ for memory optimization
class SlottedRideRecord:
    __slots__ = ['route', 'date', 'daytype', 'rides']

    def __init__(self, route, date, daytype, rides):
        self.route = route
        self.date = date
        self.daytype = daytype
        self.rides = rides

# Define a regular class for rides data
class RegularRideRecord:
    def __init__(self, route, date, daytype, rides):
        self.route = route
        self.date = date
        self.daytype = daytype
        self.rides = rides

# Function to read data as tuples
def read_as_tuples(filename):
    records = []
    with open(filename) as f:
        rows = csv.reader(f)
        next(rows)  # Skip headers
        for row in rows:
            record = (row[0], row[1], row[2], int(row[3]))
            records.append(record)
    return records

# Function to read data as dictionaries
def read_as_dicts(filename):
    records = []
    with open(filename) as f:
        rows = csv.reader(f)
        headers = next(rows)  # Get headers
        for row in rows:
            record = {
                'route': row[0],
                'date': row[1],
                'daytype': row[2],
                'rides': int(row[3])
            }
            records.append(record)
    return records

# Function to read data as named tuples
def read_as_named_tuples(filename):
    records = []
    with open(filename) as f:
        rows = csv.reader(f)
        next(rows)  # Skip headers
        for row in rows:
            record = RideRecord(row[0], row[1], row[2], int(row[3]))
            records.append(record)
    return records

# Function to read data as regular class instances
def read_as_regular_classes(filename):
    records = []
    with open(filename) as f:
        rows = csv.reader(f)
        next(rows)  # Skip headers
        for row in rows:
            record = RegularRideRecord(row[0], row[1], row[2], int(row[3]))
            records.append(record)
    return records

# Function to read data as slotted class instances
def read_as_slotted_classes(filename):
    records = []
    with open(filename) as f:
        rows = csv.reader(f)
        next(rows)  # Skip headers
        for row in rows:
            record = SlottedRideRecord(row[0], row[1], row[2], int(row[3]))
            records.append(record)
    return records

# Function to measure memory usage
def measure_memory(func, filename):
    tracemalloc.start()

    records = func(filename)

    current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()

    # Demonstrate how to use each data structure
    first_record = records[0]
    if func.__name__ == 'read_as_tuples':
        route, date, daytype, rides = first_record
    elif func.__name__ == 'read_as_dicts':
        route = first_record['route']
        date = first_record['date']
        daytype = first_record['daytype']
        rides = first_record['rides']
    else:  # named tuples and classes
        route = first_record.route
        date = first_record.date
        daytype = first_record.daytype
        rides = first_record.rides

    print(f"Structure type: {func.__name__}")
    print(f"Record count: {len(records)}")
    print(f"Example access: Route={route}, Date={date}, Rides={rides}")
    print(f"Current memory: {current/1024/1024:.2f} MB")
    print(f"Peak memory: {peak/1024/1024:.2f} MB")
    print("-" * 50)

    tracemalloc.stop()

    return current

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = '/home/labex/project/ctabus.csv'

    # Run all memory tests
    print("Memory usage comparison for different data structures:\n")

    results = []
    for reader_func in [
        read_as_tuples,
        read_as_dicts,
        read_as_named_tuples,
        read_as_regular_classes,
        read_as_slotted_classes
    ]:
        memory = measure_memory(reader_func, filename)
        results.append((reader_func.__name__, memory))

    # Sort by memory usage (lowest first)
    results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    print("\nRanking by memory efficiency (most efficient first):")
    for i, (name, memory) in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {name}: {memory/1024/1024:.2f} MB")
```

Run the script to see the comparison results:

```bash
python3 /home/labex/project/compare_structures.py
```

The output will show the memory usage for each data structure, along with a ranking from most to least memory-efficient.

## Understanding the Different Data Structures

1. **Tuples**:

   - Lightweight, immutable sequences
   - Access elements by numeric index: `record[0]`, `record[1]`, etc.
   - Very memory efficient
   - Less readable due to numeric indexing

2. **Dictionaries**:

   - Key-value pairs for named access
   - More readable: `record['route']`, `record['date']`, etc.
   - Higher memory usage due to hash table overhead
   - Flexible (can add/remove fields)

3. **Named Tuples**:

   - Combines tuple efficiency with named access
   - Readable access: `record.route`, `record.date`, etc.
   - Immutable like regular tuples
   - More memory efficient than dictionaries

4. **Regular Classes**:

   - Object-oriented approach with named attributes
   - Readable access: `record.route`, `record.date`, etc.
   - Can add methods for behavior
   - Uses more memory due to instance dictionaries

5. **Classes with **slots\*\*\*\*:
   - Memory-optimized classes that avoid instance dictionaries
   - Still provides named access: `record.route`, `record.date`, etc.
   - Restricts adding new attributes after creation
   - More memory efficient than regular classes

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Tuples**: When memory is critical and you only need simple indexed access
- **Dictionaries**: When flexibility is needed (fields may vary)
- **Named Tuples**: When you need both readability and memory efficiency
- **Regular Classes**: When you need to add behavior (methods) to your data
- **Classes with **slots\*\*\*\*: When you need behavior and maximum memory efficiency

By choosing the right data structure for your needs, you can significantly improve the performance and memory usage of your Python programs, especially when working with large datasets.

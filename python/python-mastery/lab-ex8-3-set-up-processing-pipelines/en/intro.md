# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use coroutines to establish processing pipelines for data flow. Coroutines are a powerful Python feature that enables cooperative multitasking, allowing functions to yield execution and resume later from where they left off.

**Objectives:**

- Understand how coroutines work in Python
- Implement coroutine-based data processing pipelines
- Transform data through multiple coroutine stages

**Files to Create:**

- `cofollow.py` - A coroutine-based file follower
- `coticker.py` - A stock ticker application using coroutines

**Prerequisites:**
For this exercise, we assume the `stocksim.py` program from a previous exercise is still running in the background, generating stock data in a log file.

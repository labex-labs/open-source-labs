# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use coroutines to build data processing pipelines. Coroutines, a powerful Python feature, support cooperative multitasking, enabling functions to pause and resume execution at a later point.

The objectives of this lab are to understand how coroutines work in Python, implement data processing pipelines based on coroutines, and transform data through multiple coroutine stages. You will create two files: `cofollow.py`, a coroutine-based file follower, and `coticker.py`, a stock ticker application using coroutines. It is assumed that the `stocksim.py` program from a previous exercise is still running in the background, generating stock data in a log file.

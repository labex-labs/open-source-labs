# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use coroutines to build data processing pipelines in Python. Key concepts include understanding coroutine basics, such as how they operate, the need for priming, and using decorators for initialization. You also explored data flow, pushing data through a pipeline via the `send()` method, different from the generator's "pull" model.

Moreover, you created specialized coroutines for tasks like parsing CSV data, filtering records, and formatting output. You learned to compose pipelines by connecting multiple coroutines and implemented filtering and transformation operations. Coroutines offer a powerful approach for streaming data processing, enabling clean separation of concerns and easy modification of individual stages.

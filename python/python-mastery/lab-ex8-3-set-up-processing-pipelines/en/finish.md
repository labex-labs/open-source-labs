# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use coroutines to create data processing pipelines in Python. Here are the key concepts covered:

1. **Coroutine Basics**: You learned how coroutines work, how they need to be primed, and how to use decorators to simplify their initialization.

2. **Data Flow**: You saw how data can be "pushed" through a pipeline using the `send()` method, in contrast to the "pull" model used with generators.

3. **Pipeline Components**: You created specialized coroutines for different processing tasks like parsing CSV data, filtering records, and formatting output.

4. **Pipeline Composition**: You learned how to connect multiple coroutines together to form processing pipelines.

5. **Filtering and Transformation**: You implemented various filtering and transformation operations to process and display specific data of interest.

Coroutines provide a powerful way to handle streaming data processing, especially when you need to set up complex data flows with multiple processing stages. They allow for clean separation of concerns and make it easy to modify individual stages without affecting the rest of the pipeline.

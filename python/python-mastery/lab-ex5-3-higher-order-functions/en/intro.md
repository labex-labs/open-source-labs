# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about higher-order functions in Python. Higher-order functions can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as results. This concept is crucial in functional programming and enables you to write more modular and reusable code.

You will understand what higher-order functions are, create one that takes a function as an argument, refactor existing functions to use a higher-order function, and utilize Python's built-in `map()` function. The `reader.py` file will be modified during the lab.

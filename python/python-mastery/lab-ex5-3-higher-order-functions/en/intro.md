# Introduction

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. This concept is fundamental in functional programming and allows for more modular, reusable code. In this lab, you will learn how to implement and use higher-order functions in Python to improve your code structure.

**Objectives:**

- Understand what higher-order functions are
- Create a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument
- Refactor existing functions to use a higher-order function
- Use Python's built-in `map()` function

**Files Modified:** `reader.py`

# Summary

In this lab, you learned about higher-order functions in Python and how they can be used to write more modular and maintainable code. You:

1. Identified code duplication in two similar functions
2. Created a higher-order function `convert_csv()` that takes a conversion function as an argument
3. Refactored the original functions to use the new higher-order function
4. Updated the higher-order function to use Python's built-in `map()` function

These techniques are powerful tools in a Python programmer's toolkit:

- Higher-order functions allow for greater code reuse and separation of concerns
- Passing functions as arguments enables more flexible and customizable behavior
- Functions like `map()` provide concise ways to transform data

By mastering these concepts, you can write Python code that is more concise, more maintainable, and less prone to bugs.

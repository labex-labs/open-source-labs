# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about higher-order functions in Python and how they contribute to writing more modular and maintainable code. First, you identified code duplication in two similar functions. Then, you created a higher-order function `convert_csv()` that accepts a conversion function as an argument and refactored the original functions to use it. Finally, you updated the higher-order function to utilize Python's built-in `map()` function.

These techniques are powerful assets in a Python programmer's toolkit. Higher-order functions promote code reuse and separation of concerns, while passing functions as arguments allows for more flexible and customizable behavior. Functions like `map()` offer concise ways to transform data. Mastering these concepts enables you to write Python code that is more concise, maintainable, and less error-prone.

# Summary

In this lab, you have explored the behavior of inheritance in Python and learned several important concepts:

1. The difference between single and multiple inheritance
2. How the `super()` function navigates the Method Resolution Order (MRO)
3. How to implement cooperative multiple inheritance
4. How to apply inheritance to build a practical validation system

You created a flexible validation framework using inheritance and applied it to a real-world example with the `Stock` class. This demonstrates how inheritance can be used to create reusable, composable components.

The key takeaways from this lab are:

- In single inheritance, `super()` calls the next method in the inheritance chain
- In multiple inheritance, `super()` follows the Method Resolution Order defined by the child class
- Multiple inheritance allows you to compose functionality from different sources
- Property setters can use validators to ensure that object attributes have valid values

These concepts are fundamental to object-oriented programming in Python and are used extensively in real-world applications.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about the behavior of inheritance in Python and grasped several key concepts. You explored the difference between single and multiple inheritance, understood how the `super()` function navigates the Method Resolution Order (MRO), learned to implement cooperative multiple inheritance, and applied inheritance to build a practical validation system.

You also created a flexible validation framework using inheritance and applied it to a real - world example with the `Stock` class, which shows how inheritance can create reusable and composable components. The key takeaways include how `super()` works in single and multiple inheritance, the ability of multiple inheritance to compose functionality, and the use of property setters with validators. These concepts are fundamental to Python's object - oriented programming and widely used in real - world applications.

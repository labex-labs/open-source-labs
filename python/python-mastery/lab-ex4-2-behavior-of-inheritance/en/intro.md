# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the behavior of inheritance in Python. Specifically, you'll focus on how the `super()` function operates and how cooperative inheritance is implemented. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object - oriented programming, enabling classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes for code reuse and hierarchical class structures.

In this hands - on experience, you'll understand different types of inheritance in Python, including single and multiple inheritance. You'll also learn to use the `super()` function to navigate inheritance hierarchies, implement a practical example of cooperative multiple inheritance, and apply these concepts to build a validation system. The main file created during this lab is `validate.py`.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will explore the behavior of inheritance in Python, focusing on how the `super()` function works and how cooperative inheritance is implemented. Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, enabling code reuse and hierarchical class structures.

**Objectives:**

- Understand different types of inheritance in Python (single and multiple)
- Learn how the `super()` function navigates inheritance hierarchies
- Implement a practical example of cooperative multiple inheritance
- Apply inheritance concepts to build a validation system

**Files Created:** `validate.py`

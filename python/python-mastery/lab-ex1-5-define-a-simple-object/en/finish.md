# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to define a Python class with attributes and methods, create class instances with specific attribute values, access object attributes, and call object methods. You also learned to format and display object information in various ways, work with multiple objects of the same class, and enhance a class by adding new methods.

These object - oriented programming concepts are fundamental in Python and serve as the basis for organizing code in larger applications. Classes help group related data and functionality, making your code more modular and easier to maintain. To further improve your skills, consider adding features to the `Stock` class, such as data validation, methods to update shares or price, and a method to calculate profit or loss.

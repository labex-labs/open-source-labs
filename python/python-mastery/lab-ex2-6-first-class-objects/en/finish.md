# Summary

In this lab, you explored several important Python concepts:

1. **First-Class Objects**: You learned how Python treats functions, types, and other entities as first-class objects that can be passed around and stored like any other data.

2. **CSV Data Processing**: You created reusable utility functions for reading and processing CSV data with automatic type conversion.

3. **Memory Optimization**: You explored Python's memory model and used string interning to reduce memory usage when working with repetitive data.

4. **Column-Oriented Storage**: You implemented a more efficient way to store large datasets by organizing data in columns rather than rows, while still presenting a familiar interface to the user.

These concepts demonstrate Python's flexibility and power for data processing tasks. The techniques you've learned can be applied to real-world data analysis projects, where optimizing memory usage and creating reusable code are essential skills.

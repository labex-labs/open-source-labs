# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several key Python concepts. First, you understood how Python treats functions, types, and other entities as first-class objects, allowing them to be passed around and stored like regular data. Second, you created reusable utility functions for CSV data processing with automatic type conversion.

Moreover, you explored Python's memory model and used string interning to reduce memory usage for repetitive data. You also implemented a more efficient column-oriented storage method for large datasets, providing a familiar user interface. These concepts showcase Python's flexibility and power in data processing, and the techniques can be applied to real-world data analysis projects.

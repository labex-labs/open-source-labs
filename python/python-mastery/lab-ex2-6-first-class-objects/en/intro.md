# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about Python's first - class object concept and explore its memory model. Python treats functions, types, and data as first - class objects, allowing for powerful and flexible programming patterns.

You will also create reusable utility functions for CSV data processing. Specifically, you'll create a generalized function for reading CSV data in the `reader.py` file, which can be reused across different projects.

# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Understand Python's first-class object concept
- Explore Python's memory model
- Create reusable utility functions for CSV data processing

**Files Created:** `reader.py`

Python treats everything as an object, including functions, types, and data. This treatment, known as "first-class objects," enables powerful and flexible programming patterns. In this lab, you'll explore this concept by creating a generalized function for reading CSV data, which you can reuse across different projects.

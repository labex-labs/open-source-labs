# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn to review basic file input and output operations in Python. You'll create a Python program to read data from a file with stock portfolio information and calculate the portfolio's total cost.

The objectives of this lab include learning how to open and read files in Python, processing data from files line by line, performing calculations on the data, and outputting the results. The file you will create is `pcost.py`.

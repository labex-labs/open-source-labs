# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to:

- Open and read files in Python using the `open()` function and a context manager (`with` statement)
- Process data from files line by line
- Parse and extract information from text data
- Perform calculations based on the extracted data
- Handle potential errors in file operations
- Structure a complete Python program with functions and a main block

These basic file I/O skills are fundamental to many Python programs and will be useful in various applications, from data analysis to configuration management.

You can further enhance this program by:

- Adding command-line arguments to specify the filename
- Handling different file formats
- Adding more sophisticated error checking and data validation
- Creating a report with more detailed information about the portfolio

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to perform basic file I/O operations in Python. You can open and read files using the `open()` function and a context manager, process data line by line, parse text data, perform calculations, handle errors, and structure a complete Python program with functions and a main block.

These skills are fundamental for many Python programs and are useful in various applications, such as data analysis and configuration management. You can further enhance the program by adding command - line arguments, handling different file formats, improving error checking, and creating more detailed reports.

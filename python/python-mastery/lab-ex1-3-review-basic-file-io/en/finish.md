# Summary

In this lab, you have reviewed and practiced basic file I/O operations in Python:

- You learned how to open and read a file using the `with` statement, which ensures proper file handling.
- You processed the file line by line, parsing each line into its component parts.
- You performed calculations on the parsed data (multiplying shares by price).
- You accumulated a running total to compute the final result.
- You implemented error handling to make your program more robust.
- You added command-line argument support to enhance usability.

These file I/O operations are fundamental skills in Python programming and are applicable to many real-world scenarios, such as data analysis, configuration management, and log processing.

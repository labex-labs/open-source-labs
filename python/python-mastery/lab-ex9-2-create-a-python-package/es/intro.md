In this lab, you will learn how to create and organize a Python package. Python packages are a great way to structure your code, making it more modular, reusable, and maintainable.

The objectives of this lab are to understand what a Python package is, create a basic package structure, organize related Python modules into a cohesive package, and update import statements to work with the new package structure.

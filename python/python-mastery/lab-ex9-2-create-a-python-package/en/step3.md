# Fixing Import Statements

Now, let's understand why we need to do this. When we moved our files into the `structly` package, the way Python looks for modules has changed. Import statements in each file need to be updated to match the new package structure. This is crucial because Python uses these import statements to find and use the code from other modules.

The `structure.py` file is very important to update. It imports functions and classes from the `validate.py` file. Since both of these files are now in the same `structly` package, we have to adjust the import statement accordingly.

Let's start by opening the `structly/structure.py` file in the editor. You can either click on `structly/structure.py` in the file explorer or run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
# Click on structly/structure.py in the file explorer or run:
code structly/structure.py
```

Once the file is open, look at the first line of the import statement. It currently looks like this:

```python
from validate import validate_type, PositiveInteger, PositiveFloat, String
```

This statement was correct when the files were in a different structure. But now, we need to change it to tell Python to look for the `validate` module within the same package. So, we change it to:

```python
from .validate import validate_type, PositiveInteger, PositiveFloat, String
```

The dot (`.`) before `validate` is a key part here. It's a special syntax in Python called a relative import. It tells Python to search for the `validate` module in the same package as the current module (which is `structure.py` in this case).

After making this change, make sure to save the file. Saving is important because it makes the changes permanent, and Python will use the updated import statement when you run your code.

Now, let's check our other files to see if they need any updates.

1. `structly/reader.py` - This file doesn't import from any of our custom modules. That means we don't need to make any changes to it.
2. `structly/tableformat.py` - Similar to the `reader.py` file, this one also doesn't import from any of our custom modules. So, no changes are required here either.
3. `structly/validate.py` - Just like the previous two files, it doesn't import from any of our custom modules. Hence, we don't need to modify it.

In real - world programming, your projects might have more complex relationships between modules. When you move files around to create or modify a package structure, always remember to update the import statements. This ensures that your code can find and use the necessary modules correctly.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to create and structure a Python package. Specifically, you understood the concept and usefulness of Python packages for code organization, created a basic package structure, moved Python modules into it, updated import statements, and modified code to use the package correctly.

These skills are crucial for developing larger Python applications, as proper code organization becomes increasingly important. Python packages help keep related code together, avoid naming conflicts, and make your code more reusable, maintainable, and shareable. Well - structured packages are a cornerstone of professional Python development as you continue your Python journey.

# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create and structure a Python package. Specifically, you:

1. Understood what a Python package is and why it is useful for organizing code
2. Created a basic package structure with a directory and `__init__.py` file
3. Moved Python modules into the package structure
4. Updated import statements to work with the new package structure
5. Modified code to use the package correctly

These skills are essential for developing larger Python applications where code organization becomes increasingly important. Python packages help you:

- Keep related code together
- Avoid naming conflicts
- Make your code more reusable and maintainable
- Share your code more easily with others

As you continue your Python journey, you'll find that well-structured packages are a cornerstone of professional Python development.

# Understanding Python Packages

A Python package is a directory that contains multiple Python module files and a special `__init__.py` file. This structure allows you to organize related code into a single directory hierarchy. Packages provide a way to:

1. Structure your code logically
2. Avoid naming conflicts between modules
3. Make importing and using your code more convenient

Let's examine the files we currently have in our project directory:

```bash
ls -l
```

You should see the following files:

```
portfolio.csv
reader.py
stock.py
structure.py
tableformat.py
validate.py
```

These Python files work together but are currently separate modules. In this lab, we will organize them into a cohesive package called `structly`.

Here's a brief description of what each file does:

- `structure.py`: Defines a base `Structure` class and various descriptors for type validation
- `validate.py`: Contains validation functionality used by the structure module
- `reader.py`: Provides functions to read CSV data
- `tableformat.py`: Contains classes and functions for formatting data into tables
- `stock.py`: Uses the other modules to define a `Stock` class and process stock data

In the next step, we'll create our package structure.

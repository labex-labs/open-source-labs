# Understanding Python Packages

Before we start creating a Python package, let's understand what a Python package is. A Python package is essentially a directory. Inside this directory, there are multiple Python module files, which are just `.py` files containing Python code. Additionally, there is a special file named `__init__.py`. This file can be empty, but its presence indicates that the directory is a Python package. The purpose of this structure is to help you organize related code into a single directory hierarchy.

Packages offer several benefits. First, they allow you to structure your code logically. Instead of having all your Python files scattered around, you can group related functionality together in a package. Second, they help avoid naming conflicts between modules. Since packages create a namespace, you can have modules with the same name in different packages without any issues. Third, they make importing and using your code more convenient. You can import an entire package or specific modules from it with ease.

Now, let's take a look at the files we currently have in our project directory. To list the files, we'll use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
ls -l
```

When you run this command, you should see the following files:

```
portfolio.csv
reader.py
stock.py
structure.py
tableformat.py
validate.py
```

These Python files are all related and work together, but currently, they are just separate modules. In this lab, our goal is to organize them into a cohesive package called `structly`.

Let's briefly understand what each file does:

- `structure.py`: This file defines a base `Structure` class and various descriptors. These descriptors are used for type validation, which means they help ensure that the data used in your program has the correct type.
- `validate.py`: It contains validation functionality that is used by the `structure` module. This helps in validating the data according to certain rules.
- `reader.py`: This file provides functions that are used to read CSV data. CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a common file format for storing tabular data.
- `tableformat.py`: It contains classes and functions that are used to format data into tables. This is useful when you want to display data in a more organized way.
- `stock.py`: This file uses the other modules to define a `Stock` class and process stock data. It combines the functionality of the other modules to perform specific tasks related to stock data.

In the next step, we'll create our package structure.

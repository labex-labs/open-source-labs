# Summary

In this lab, you learned about powerful Python mechanisms for customizing attribute access and behavior:

1. **Custom Attribute Control**: You learned how to use `__setattr__` to restrict which attributes can be set on an object, providing controlled access to object properties.

2. **Proxy Pattern**: You implemented a read-only proxy that wraps existing objects and prevents modifications while maintaining their functionality.

3. **Delegation vs. Inheritance**: You explored delegation as an alternative to inheritance for code reuse and customization. You saw how to use `__getattr__` to forward method calls to a wrapped object.

These techniques provide you with flexible ways to control object behavior beyond standard inheritance. They're particularly useful for:

- Creating controlled interfaces to existing objects
- Implementing access restrictions or validation
- Adding cross-cutting behaviors like logging or monitoring
- Composing behavior from multiple sources

Understanding these patterns allows you to write more maintainable and flexible Python code that leverages the full power of Python's object model.

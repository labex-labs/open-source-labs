# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about powerful Python mechanisms for customizing attribute access and behavior. You explored how to use `__setattr__` to control which attributes can be set on an object, enabling controlled access to object properties. Additionally, you implemented a read - only proxy to wrap existing objects, preventing modifications while preserving their functionality.

You also delved into the difference between delegation and inheritance for code reuse and customization. By using `__getattr__`, you learned to forward method calls to a wrapped object. These techniques offer flexible ways to control object behavior beyond standard inheritance, useful for creating controlled interfaces, implementing access restrictions, adding cross - cutting behaviors, and composing behavior from multiple sources. Understanding these patterns helps you write more maintainable and flexible Python code.

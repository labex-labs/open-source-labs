# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about a fundamental aspect of Python's object-oriented programming: attribute access. Python enables developers to customize how attributes are accessed, set, and managed in classes through special methods. This offers powerful ways to control object behavior.

In addition, you will learn how to customize attribute access in Python classes, understand the difference between delegation and inheritance, and practice implementing custom attribute management in Python objects.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn to enhance your understanding of type checking and interfaces in Python. By extending a table formatting module, you'll implement concepts such as abstract base classes and interface validation to create more robust and maintainable code.

This lab builds upon concepts from previous exercises, focusing on type safety and interface design patterns. Your objectives include implementing type checking for function parameters, creating and using interfaces with abstract base classes, and applying the template method pattern to reduce code duplication. You will modify `tableformat.py`, a module for formatting data as tables, and `reader.py`, a module for reading CSV files.

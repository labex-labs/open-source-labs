# Introduction

In this lab, you will enhance your understanding of type checking and interfaces in Python by extending a table formatting module. You will implement concepts like abstract base classes and interface validation to create more robust and maintainable code.

**Objectives:**

- Implement type checking for function parameters
- Create and use interfaces with abstract base classes
- Apply the template method pattern to reduce code duplication

**Files You Will Modify:**

- `tableformat.py` - A module for formatting data as tables
- `reader.py` - A module for reading CSV files

This lab builds upon concepts from previous exercises, specifically focusing on type safety and interface design patterns.

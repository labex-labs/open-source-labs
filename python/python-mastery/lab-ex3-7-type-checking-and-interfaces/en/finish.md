# Summary

In this lab, you have enhanced Python code with important object-oriented programming concepts:

1. **Type Checking**: You implemented type checking in the `print_table()` function to ensure that only valid formatters are used, improving the robustness of your code.

2. **Abstract Base Classes**: You converted the `TableFormatter` class into a proper abstract base class, enforcing a contract that all subclasses must implement specific methods.

3. **Template Method Pattern**: You applied the template method pattern by creating the `CSVParser` abstract base class and concrete implementations, reducing code duplication while maintaining a consistent algorithm structure.

These techniques are valuable for creating more maintainable and robust Python code, especially in larger applications where proper interface definitions and type checking can prevent many common errors.

To continue your learning journey, consider exploring:

- Type hints in Python (PEP 484)
- Protocol classes (structural subtyping)
- Design patterns in Python

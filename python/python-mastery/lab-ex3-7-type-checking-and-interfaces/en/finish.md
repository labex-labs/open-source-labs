# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several key object - oriented programming concepts to enhance Python code. First, you implemented type checking in the `print_table()` function, which ensures that only valid formatters are used, thus improving the code's robustness. Second, you transformed the `TableFormatter` class into an abstract base class, enforcing subclasses to implement specific methods.

Moreover, you applied the template method pattern by creating the `CSVParser` abstract base class and its concrete implementations. This reduces code duplication while maintaining a consistent algorithm structure. These techniques are crucial for creating more maintainable and robust Python code, especially in large - scale applications. To further your learning, explore type hints in Python (PEP 484), protocol classes, and design patterns in Python.

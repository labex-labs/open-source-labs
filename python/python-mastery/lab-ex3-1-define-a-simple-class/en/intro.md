# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn to enhance a `Stock` class designed to represent stock holdings. You'll add new methods and functionality to this class, making it more versatile and useful.

The objectives of this lab include adding a `sell` method to the existing `Stock` class, creating a function to read stock portfolio data from a CSV file, and another function to display the portfolio data in a formatted table. The file to be modified is `stock.py`.

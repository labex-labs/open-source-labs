# Summary

Congratulations on completing this lab where you enhanced a `Stock` class with new functionality.

In this lab, you:

1. Added a `sell` method to the `Stock` class to simulate selling shares of a stock
2. Created a `read_portfolio` function to read stock data from a CSV file and convert it into `Stock` objects
3. Created a `print_portfolio` function to display the portfolio data in a nicely formatted table

These skills are fundamental to object-oriented programming in Python:

- Defining methods in a class
- Working with files and parsing data
- Formatting output for better readability

You can now apply these concepts to create more complex classes and utilities in your Python programs.

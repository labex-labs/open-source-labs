# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to enhance a `Stock` class with new functionality. You added a `sell` method to simulate selling shares, created a `read_portfolio` function to read stock data from a CSV file and convert it into `Stock` objects, and developed a `print_portfolio` function to display portfolio data in a well - formatted table.

These skills, including defining methods in a class, working with files and parsing data, and formatting output for better readability, are fundamental to object - oriented programming in Python. You can now apply these concepts to create more complex classes and utilities in your Python programs.

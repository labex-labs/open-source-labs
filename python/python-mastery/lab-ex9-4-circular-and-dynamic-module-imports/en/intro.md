# Introduction

In Python, module imports can sometimes create complex dependencies that lead to errors or inefficient code structures. This lab focuses on two important import-related concepts:

**Circular imports** occur when two or more modules import each other, creating a dependency loop that can cause errors if not handled correctly.

**Dynamic imports** allow modules to be loaded at runtime rather than at the beginning of a program, providing flexibility and avoiding import-related issues.

**Objectives:**

- Explore and understand circular import problems
- Implement solutions to avoid circular imports
- Learn how to use dynamic module imports effectively

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about two crucial import-related concepts in Python. Module imports in Python can sometimes result in complex dependencies, leading to errors or inefficient code structures. Circular imports, where two or more modules import each other, create a dependency loop that can cause issues if not properly managed.

You will also explore dynamic imports, which enable modules to be loaded at runtime instead of at the program's start. This provides flexibility and helps avoid import-related problems. The objectives of this lab are to understand circular import problems, implement solutions to avoid them, and learn how to use dynamic module imports effectively.

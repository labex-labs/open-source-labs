# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about crucial Python module import concepts and techniques. First, you explored circular imports, understanding how circular dependencies between modules can lead to issues and why careful handling is necessary to avoid them. Second, you implemented subclass registration, a pattern where subclasses register with their parent class, eliminating the need for direct subclass imports.

You also used the `__import__()` function for dynamic imports, loading modules at runtime only when required. This makes the code more flexible and helps avoid circular dependencies. These techniques are essential for creating maintainable Python packages with complex module relationships and are commonly used in frameworks and libraries. Applying these patterns to your projects can help you build more modular, extensible, and maintainable code structures.

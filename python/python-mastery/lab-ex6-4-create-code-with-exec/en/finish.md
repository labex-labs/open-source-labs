# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use Python's `exec()` function to dynamically create and execute code at runtime. The key points include the basic usage of `exec()` for executing string-based code fragments, advanced usage for dynamically creating class methods based on attributes, and its real-world application in Python's standard library with `namedtuple`.

The ability to generate code dynamically is a powerful feature that allows for more flexible and adaptable programs. Although it should be used with caution due to security and readability concerns, it is a valuable tool for Python programmers in specific scenarios such as creating APIs, implementing decorators, or building domain-specific languages. You can apply these techniques when creating code that adapts to runtime conditions or building frameworks that generate code based on configuration.

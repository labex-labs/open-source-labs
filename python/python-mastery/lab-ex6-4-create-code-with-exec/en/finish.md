# Summary

In this lab, you've learned how to use Python's `exec()` function to dynamically create and execute code at runtime. Here are the key points covered:

1. Basic usage of `exec()` to execute string-based code fragments
2. Advanced usage to dynamically create class methods based on attributes
3. Real-world application in Python's standard library with `namedtuple`

The ability to generate code dynamically is a powerful feature that enables more flexible and adaptable programs. While it should be used carefully due to security and readability concerns, it's a valuable tool in the Python programmer's toolkit for certain use cases like creating APIs, implementing decorators, or building domain-specific languages.

You can apply these techniques when you need to create code that adapts to runtime conditions or when building frameworks that generate code based on configuration.

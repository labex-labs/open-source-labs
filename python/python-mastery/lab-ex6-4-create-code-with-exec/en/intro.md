# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the `exec()` function in Python. This function allows you to execute Python code represented as a string dynamically. It's a powerful feature that enables you to generate and run code at runtime, making your programs more flexible and adaptable.

The objectives of this lab are to learn the basic usage of the `exec()` function, use it to dynamically create class methods, and examine how Python's standard library uses `exec()` behind the scenes.

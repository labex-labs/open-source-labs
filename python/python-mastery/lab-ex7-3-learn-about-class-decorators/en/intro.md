# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Learn about class decorators in Python
- Revisit and extend Python descriptors
- Combine these concepts to create powerful and clean code structures

**Files Modified:** `validate.py`, `structure.py`

In this lab, you will build upon previous concepts of descriptors and extend them with class decorators. This powerful combination allows for creating cleaner, more maintainable code with enhanced validation capabilities.

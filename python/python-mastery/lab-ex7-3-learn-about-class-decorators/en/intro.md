# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about class decorators in Python and revisit and extend Python descriptors. By combining these concepts, you can create powerful and clean code structures.

In this lab, you will build on previous descriptor concepts and extend them using class decorators. This combination enables you to create cleaner, more maintainable code with enhanced validation capabilities. The files to be modified are `validate.py` and `structure.py`.

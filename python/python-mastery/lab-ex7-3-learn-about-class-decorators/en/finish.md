# Summary

Congratulations on completing the Class Decorators lab! You've learned how to combine powerful Python features to create clean, self-validating code.

Key concepts you've mastered:

- Using descriptors for attribute validation
- Creating class decorators to automate code generation
- Applying decorators automatically through inheritance
- Converting data rows to class instances
- Validating method arguments with annotations

These techniques provide powerful tools for creating robust, maintainable Python code. They allow you to express validation requirements clearly and concisely, while automatically enforcing them throughout your codebase.

You can now apply these patterns in your own Python projects to improve code quality and reduce boilerplate code.

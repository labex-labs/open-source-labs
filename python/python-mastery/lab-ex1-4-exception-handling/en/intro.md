# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to review the definition of simple functions in Python and explore exception handling. Functions are a key programming concept that enables you to structure code into reusable segments. Exception handling, on the other hand, is a method for dealing with errors and unforeseen circumstances in your programs.

The main objectives of this lab are to review the process of defining simple functions and to learn about exception handling in Python. The file that will be modified is `pcost.py`.

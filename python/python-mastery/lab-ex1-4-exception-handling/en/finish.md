# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several key Python programming concepts. First, you learned how to define and use functions, which makes your code reusable. Second, you mastered implementing exception handling, enhancing the robustness of your programs. Lastly, you discovered how to use Python in interactive mode for testing and experimentation.

These skills are fundamental for writing reliable Python programs. Functions help organize and reuse code, exception handling enables graceful handling of unexpected situations, and interactive mode offers a powerful environment for testing and debugging. As you progress in your Python learning, these concepts will prove increasingly valuable for developing larger and more complex applications.

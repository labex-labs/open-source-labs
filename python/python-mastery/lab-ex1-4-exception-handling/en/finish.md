# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several important Python programming concepts:

1. How to define and use functions to make your code reusable
2. How to implement exception handling to make your programs more robust
3. How to use Python in interactive mode for testing and experimentation

These skills form a solid foundation for writing reliable Python programs. Functions allow you to organize and reuse code, exception handling helps your programs deal with unexpected situations gracefully, and interactive mode provides a powerful environment for testing and debugging.

As you continue your Python journey, these concepts will become increasingly valuable in developing larger and more complex applications.

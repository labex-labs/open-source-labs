# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about class variables and class methods in Python. You'll understand their purpose and usage, and learn how to define and use class methods effectively.

Moreover, you'll implement alternative constructors using class methods, explore the relationship between class variables and inheritance, and create flexible data reading utilities. The files `stock.py` and `reader.py` will be modified during this lab.

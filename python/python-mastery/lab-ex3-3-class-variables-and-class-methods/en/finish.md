# Summary

In this lab, you've learned about two important Python features: class variables and class methods.

**Key concepts covered:**

- **Class variables** are shared among all instances of a class and can be used for configuration settings
- **Class methods** operate on the class itself rather than instances and are marked with the `@classmethod` decorator
- **Alternative constructors** are a common use case for class methods, providing different ways to create objects
- **Inheritance** with class variables allows subclasses to customize behavior by overriding class variables
- **Flexible code design** can be achieved by using class methods as a consistent interface across different classes

These concepts are powerful tools for creating well-organized, flexible code in Python. By placing type conversions inside the class and providing a uniform interface through class methods, you can write more general-purpose utilities that work with a variety of classes.

You can extend what you've learned by:

- Exploring more use cases for class variables and class methods
- Creating hierarchies of classes that share behavior but customize specific aspects
- Building more complex data processing pipelines that use class methods

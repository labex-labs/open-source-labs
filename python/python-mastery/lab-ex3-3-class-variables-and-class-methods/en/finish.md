# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about two crucial Python features: class variables and class methods. Class variables are shared among all class instances and can be used for configuration. Class methods operate on the class itself, marked with the `@classmethod` decorator. Alternative constructors, a common use of class methods, offer different ways to create objects. Inheritance with class variables enables subclasses to customize behavior by overriding them, and using class methods can achieve flexible code design.

These concepts are powerful for creating well - organized and flexible Python code. By placing type conversions within the class and providing a uniform interface via class methods, you can write more general - purpose utilities. To extend your learning, you can explore more use cases, create class hierarchies, and build complex data processing pipelines using class methods.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use Python's unittest module to create and run automated tests. You have:

- Created a basic test case by extending the `unittest.TestCase` class
- Written tests to verify normal functioning of a class's methods and properties
- Created tests to check that appropriate exceptions are raised in error conditions
- Learned how to run specific tests and use test discovery to find and run tests

Unit testing is a fundamental skill in software development that helps ensure code reliability and correctness. By writing thorough tests, you can catch bugs early and be confident that your code behaves as expected.

As you continue to develop Python applications, consider adopting a test-driven development (TDD) approach where you write tests before implementing the actual functionality. This practice can lead to more robust and maintainable code.

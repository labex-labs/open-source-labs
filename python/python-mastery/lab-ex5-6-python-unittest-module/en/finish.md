# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use Python's unittest module to create and run automated tests. You created a basic test case by extending the `unittest.TestCase` class, wrote tests to verify the normal functioning of a class's methods and properties, and created tests to check for appropriate exceptions in error conditions. You also learned how to run specific tests and use test discovery.

Unit testing is a fundamental skill in software development, ensuring code reliability and correctness. Writing thorough tests helps catch bugs early and gives confidence in your code's behavior. As you develop Python applications, consider adopting a test-driven development (TDD) approach, writing tests before implementing functionality for more robust and maintainable code.

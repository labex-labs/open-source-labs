# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Python's built - in `unittest` module. This module offers a framework for organizing and running tests, which is a crucial part of software development to ensure your code works correctly.

You'll also learn to create and run basic test cases, and test for expected errors and exceptions. The `unittest` module simplifies the process of creating test suites, running tests, and verifying results. The file `teststock.py` will be created during this lab.

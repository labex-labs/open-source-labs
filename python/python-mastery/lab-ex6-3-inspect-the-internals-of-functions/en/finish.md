# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to inspect the internals of Python functions through:

- Examining function attributes directly using techniques like `dir()` and accessing special attributes such as `__name__`, `__doc__`, and `__code__`
- Using the `inspect` module to get structured information about function signatures and parameters
- Applying function inspection techniques in a practical example to improve a class implementation by automatically detecting field names from method signatures

Function inspection is a powerful feature in Python that enables you to write more dynamic, flexible, and maintainable code. The ability to examine and manipulate function properties at runtime opens up possibilities for metaprogramming, creating self-documenting code, and building advanced frameworks.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to inspect the internals of Python functions. You examined function attributes directly using methods like `dir()` and accessed special attributes such as `__name__`, `__doc__`, and `__code__`. You also used the `inspect` module to obtain structured information about function signatures and parameters.

Function inspection is a powerful Python feature that allows you to write more dynamic, flexible, and maintainable code. The ability to examine and manipulate function properties at runtime offers possibilities for metaprogramming, creating self - documenting code, and building advanced frameworks.

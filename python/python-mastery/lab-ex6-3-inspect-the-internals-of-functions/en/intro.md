# Introduction

In Python, functions are objects with their own attributes and methods that you can examine. Understanding these internals can provide deeper insights into how functions work and allow you to create more powerful, adaptable code.

**Objectives:**

- Learn how to inspect function attributes and properties
- Use the inspect module to examine function signatures
- Apply function inspection techniques to improve a class implementation

**Files Modified:** `structure.py`

# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Learn about Python function argument passing conventions
- Create a reusable structure for data classes
- Apply object-oriented design principles to simplify code

**Files Created:** `structure.py`, `stock.py`

**Important Note**

This exercise starts the process of rewriting the `stock.py` file in a more organized way. Before beginning, copy your existing work in `stock.py` to a new file called `orig_stock.py` for reference.

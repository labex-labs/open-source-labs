# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about Python function argument passing conventions. You'll also create a reusable structure for data classes and apply object-oriented design principles to simplify your code.

This exercise aims to rewrite the `stock.py` file in a more organized manner. Before you start, copy your existing work in `stock.py` to a new file named `orig_stock.py` for reference. The files you'll create are `structure.py` and `stock.py`.

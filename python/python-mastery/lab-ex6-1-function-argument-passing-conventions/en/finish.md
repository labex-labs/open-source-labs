# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about function argument passing conventions in Python and applied them to build a more organized and maintainable codebase. You explored Python's flexible argument - passing mechanisms, created a reusable `Structure` base class for data objects, and improved object representation for better debugging.

You also added attribute validation to prevent common errors and rewrote the `Stock` class using the new structure. These techniques showcase key object - oriented design principles such as inheritance for code reuse, encapsulation for data integrity, and polymorphism through common interfaces. By applying these principles, you can develop more robust and maintainable code with less repetition and fewer errors.

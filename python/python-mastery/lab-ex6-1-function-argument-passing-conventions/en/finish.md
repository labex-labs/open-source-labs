# Summary

In this lab, you learned about function argument passing conventions in Python and applied them to create a more organized and maintainable codebase. You:

1. Explored Python's flexible argument passing mechanisms
2. Created a reusable `Structure` base class for data objects
3. Improved object representation for better debugging
4. Added attribute validation to prevent common errors
5. Rewrote the `Stock` class to leverage your new structure

These techniques demonstrate important principles of object-oriented design:

- Inheritance for code reuse
- Encapsulation to protect data integrity
- Polymorphism through common interfaces

By using these principles, you can create more robust, maintainable code with less repetition and fewer errors.

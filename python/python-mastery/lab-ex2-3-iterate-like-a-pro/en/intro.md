# Introduction

Iteration is a fundamental concept in Python programming. It allows you to process elements in sequences like lists, tuples, and dictionaries efficiently. Mastering various iteration techniques will significantly improve your Python coding skills and help you write more concise and readable code.

In this lab, you will learn several powerful Python iteration techniques, including basic iteration with `for` loops, sequence unpacking, using built-in functions like `enumerate()` and `zip()`, and working with generator expressions to improve memory efficiency.

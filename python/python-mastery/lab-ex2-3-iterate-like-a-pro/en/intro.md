# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the fundamental concept of iteration in Python programming. Iteration enables you to efficiently process elements in sequences such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Mastering iteration techniques can significantly enhance your Python coding skills.

You will explore several powerful Python iteration techniques, including basic `for` loop iteration, sequence unpacking, using built - in functions like `enumerate()` and `zip()`, and leveraging generator expressions for better memory efficiency.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several powerful Python iteration techniques. First, you mastered basic iteration and sequence unpacking, using `for` loops to iterate over sequences and unpack them into individual variables. Second, you explored built - in functions like `enumerate()` to track indices during iteration and `zip()` to pair elements from different sequences.

These techniques are fundamental for efficient Python programming. They enable you to write more concise, readable, and memory - efficient code. By mastering these iteration patterns, you can handle data processing tasks more effectively in your Python projects.

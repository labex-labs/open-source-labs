# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several powerful Python iteration techniques:

1. **Basic Iteration and Sequence Unpacking**: You learned how to use `for` loops to iterate over sequences and how to unpack sequences into individual variables.

2. **Using Built-in Functions**: You explored the `enumerate()` function for keeping track of indices while iterating and the `zip()` function for pairing elements from different sequences.

3. **Generator Expressions and Memory Efficiency**: You discovered how to use generator expressions to process data incrementally without loading everything into memory, which is particularly useful for large datasets.

These techniques are fundamental to efficient Python programming and will help you write more concise, readable, and memory-efficient code. By mastering these iteration patterns, you can handle data processing tasks more effectively in your Python projects.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about the inner workings of Python's object system and several key concepts. First, Python objects store attributes in a dictionary accessible via the `__dict__` attribute, offering flexibility. Second, you grasped how attribute assignment and lookup work, including dynamic attribute addition and the order of attribute checking.

Moreover, you explored the relationship between classes and instances, where classes hold shared data and behavior, and instances maintain their own state. You also discovered how method calls operate, with methods in the class acting on instances through the `self` parameter. Understanding these concepts deepens your insight into Python's OOP model and is useful for debugging, designing class hierarchies, and learning advanced features.

# Summary

In this lab, you have explored the inner workings of Python's object system and learned several important concepts:

1. **Object Representation**: Python objects store their attributes in a dictionary that can be accessed through the `__dict__` attribute. This dictionary-based approach provides flexibility in working with objects.

2. **Attribute Assignment and Lookup**: You learned how attribute assignment works, how attributes can be added dynamically to objects, and how Python looks up attributes by checking the instance dictionary first, then the class dictionary.

3. **Class and Instance Relationship**: You explored the connection between classes and instances. Classes serve as repositories for shared data and behavior, while instances maintain their individual state in their own dictionaries.

4. **Method Calls**: You discovered how method calls work behind the scenes, with methods defined in the class but operating on instances through the `self` parameter.

Understanding these concepts provides a deeper insight into Python's object-oriented programming model. This knowledge is valuable for debugging, designing efficient class hierarchies, and understanding more advanced Python features like metaclasses, descriptors, and property decorators.

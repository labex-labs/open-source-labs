In this lab, you will learn how Python objects are represented internally and understand the mechanisms of attribute assignment and lookup. These concepts are fundamental to grasping how Python manages data and behavior within objects.

Additionally, you will explore the relationship between classes and instances and examine the role of class definitions in object-oriented programming. This knowledge will enhance your understanding of Python's object-oriented features.

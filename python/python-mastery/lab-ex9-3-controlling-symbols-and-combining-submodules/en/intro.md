# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn important concepts related to Python package organization. First, you'll learn how to control exported symbols using `__all__` in Python modules. This skill is crucial for managing what gets exposed from your modules.

Secondly, you'll understand how to combine submodules for simpler imports and master the technique of module splitting for better code organization. These practices will enhance the readability and maintainability of your Python code.

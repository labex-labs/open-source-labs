# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several crucial Python package organization techniques. First, you mastered the use of the `__all__` variable to explicitly define the symbols exported by a module. Second, you created a more user - friendly package interface by re - exporting submodule symbols from the top - level package.

These techniques are essential for crafting clean, maintainable, and user - friendly Python packages. They enable you to control the user's view, simplify the import process, and logically organize code as your project expands.

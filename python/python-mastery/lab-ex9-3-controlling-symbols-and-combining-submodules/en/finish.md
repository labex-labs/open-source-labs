# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several important Python package organization techniques:

1. **Controlling Exported Symbols**: You learned how to use the `__all__` variable to explicitly define what symbols a module exports.

2. **Simplifying Imports**: You created a more user-friendly package interface by re-exporting submodule symbols from the top-level package.

3. **Module Splitting**: You converted a single module file into a well-organized package with submodules, maintaining backward compatibility.

These techniques are essential for creating clean, maintainable, and user-friendly Python packages. They help you control what users see, simplify the import experience, and organize code logically as your project grows.

# Summary

In this lab, you've explored Python's scoping rules and learned some powerful techniques for working with scope:

1. You discovered how to use the `locals()` function to access all local variables in a function
2. You learned about stack frame inspection with `sys._getframe()` to access the caller's local variables
3. You applied these techniques to create a flexible class initialization system that:
   - Automatically captures and sets function parameters as object attributes
   - Maintains proper function signatures in documentation
   - Supports both positional and keyword arguments

These techniques demonstrate Python's flexibility and the power of its introspection capabilities. While frame inspection is considered an advanced technique and should be used judiciously, it can significantly reduce boilerplate code when used appropriately.

Understanding scoping rules and these advanced techniques gives you more tools for writing cleaner, more maintainable Python code.

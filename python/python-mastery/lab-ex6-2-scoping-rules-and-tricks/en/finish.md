# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about Python's scoping rules and some powerful techniques for handling scope. First, you explored how to use the `locals()` function to access all local variables within a function. Second, you learned to inspect stack frames using `sys._getframe()` to access the caller's local variables.

You also applied these techniques to create a flexible class initialization system. This system automatically captures and sets function parameters as object attributes, maintains proper function signatures in documentation, and supports both positional and keyword arguments. These techniques showcase Python's flexibility and introspection capabilities. Although frame inspection is an advanced technique that should be used carefully, it can effectively reduce boilerplate code when used appropriately. Understanding scoping rules and these advanced techniques equips you with more tools to write cleaner and more maintainable Python code.

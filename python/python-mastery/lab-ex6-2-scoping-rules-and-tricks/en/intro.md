# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about Python's scoping rules and explore advanced techniques for working with scope. Understanding scope in Python is crucial for writing clean and maintainable code, and it helps avoid unexpected behaviors.

The objectives of this lab include understanding Python's scoping rules in detail, learning practical scoping techniques for class initialization, implementing a flexible object initialization system, and applying frame inspection techniques to simplify code. You will work with the files `structure.py` and `stock.py`.

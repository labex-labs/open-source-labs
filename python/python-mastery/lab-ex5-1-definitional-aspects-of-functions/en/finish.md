# Summary

In this lab, you've learned several important aspects of function design in Python:

1. **Basic Function Design**: How to write functions to process CSV data into different data structures.

2. **Function Flexibility**: How to refactor functions to work with any iterable source, not just filenames. This makes your code more versatile and reusable.

3. **Optional Parameters**: How to add optional parameters to handle different use cases, such as CSV files with or without headers.

4. **Type Hints**: How to use Python's type hinting system to make your code more readable and maintainable.

These skills are essential for writing robust, flexible, and maintainable Python code. As your programs grow in complexity, these design principles will help keep your code organized and easy to understand.

The techniques you've learned can be applied to many other scenarios beyond CSV processing, making them valuable tools in your Python programming toolkit.

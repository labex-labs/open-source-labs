# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several key aspects of function design in Python. First, you learned basic function design, specifically how to write functions to process CSV data into various data structures. You also explored function flexibility by refactoring functions to work with any iterable source, enhancing code versatility and reusability.

Moreover, you mastered adding optional parameters to handle different use - cases, like CSV files with or without headers, and using Python's type hinting system to improve code readability and maintainability. These skills are crucial for writing robust Python code, and as your programs become more complex, these design principles will keep your code organized and understandable. The techniques can be applied beyond CSV processing, making them valuable in your Python programming toolkit.

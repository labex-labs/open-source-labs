# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about descriptors in Python, a powerful mechanism for customizing attribute access in objects. Descriptors allow you to define how attributes are accessed, set, and deleted, giving you control over object behavior and enabling validation logic implementation.

The objectives of this lab include understanding the descriptor protocol, creating and using custom descriptors, implementing data validation with descriptors, and optimizing descriptor implementations. You will create several files during the lab, including `descrip.py`, `stock.py`, and `validate.py`.

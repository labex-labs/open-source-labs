# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about Python descriptors, a powerful feature enabling customization of attribute access in classes. You explored the descriptor protocol, including the `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods. You also created a basic descriptor class to intercept attribute access and used descriptors to implement a validation system for data integrity.

Moreover, you enhanced your descriptors with the `__set_name__` method to reduce redundancy. Descriptors are widely used in Python libraries and frameworks such as Django and SQLAlchemy. Understanding them provides deeper insights into Python and helps you write more elegant and maintainable code.

# Summary

In this lab, you have explored Python descriptors, a powerful feature that allows you to customize attribute access in classes. Here are the key concepts you learned:

1. **Descriptor Protocol**: You learned about the `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods that form the descriptor protocol.

2. **Creating Custom Descriptors**: You created a basic descriptor class and saw how it intercepts attribute access.

3. **Practical Applications**: You used descriptors to implement a validation system that ensures data integrity.

4. **Advanced Features**: You improved your descriptors with the `__set_name__` method to reduce redundancy.

Descriptors are used extensively in Python libraries and frameworks, including Django's model fields, SQLAlchemy's ORM, and many others. Understanding descriptors gives you deeper insight into how Python works and allows you to write more elegant, maintainable code.

# Summary

Congratulations on creating your first metaclass in Python! In this lab, you have:

- Learned what metaclasses are and how they work
- Created a custom metaclass that monitors class creation
- Used your metaclass to create new classes
- Observed how metaclasses propagate through inheritance hierarchies

Metaclasses are an advanced Python feature that gives you control over class creation. While you may not need to create metaclasses every day, understanding how they work provides deeper insight into Python's object system and opens up powerful possibilities for framework and library development.

To learn more about metaclasses, you can explore the official Python documentation and advanced Python books that cover metaprogramming concepts.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned what metaclasses are and how they function in Python. You successfully created your first custom metaclass to monitor class creation and used it to generate new classes. Additionally, you observed how metaclasses propagate through inheritance hierarchies.

Metaclasses are an advanced Python feature that offers control over class creation. Although you may not create metaclasses daily, understanding them provides deeper insights into Python's object system and unlocks powerful possibilities for framework and library development. To learn more, explore the official Python documentation and advanced Python books on metaprogramming.

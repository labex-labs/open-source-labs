# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about metaclasses in Python. In Python, everything, including classes, is an object. A metaclass is a class that creates other classes, offering a powerful way to customize class creation.

The objectives of this lab are to understand what a metaclass is, create your first metaclass, use it to create new classes, and observe how metaclasses affect class inheritance. The file `mymeta.py` will be created during the lab.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn to take your first steps in Python programming. First, you'll verify that Python is correctly installed on your system. Then, you'll learn how to use the Python interactive interpreter.

Next, you'll edit and run a simple Python program. The file you'll create during this process is `art.py`.

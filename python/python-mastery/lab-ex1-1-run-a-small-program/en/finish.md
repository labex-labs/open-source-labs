# Summary

Congratulations on completing this Python fundamentals lab. You have successfully:

- Verified Python is installed correctly on your system
- Used the Python interactive interpreter to run simple commands
- Created a basic Python program that accepts user input
- Developed a more advanced program that generates ASCII art patterns
- Learned about important Python concepts including:
  - Basic syntax and data types
  - Variables and string formatting
  - Function definitions
  - Module imports
  - Command-line argument handling
  - Error handling with try/except

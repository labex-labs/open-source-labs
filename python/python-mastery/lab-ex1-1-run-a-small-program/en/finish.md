# Summary

In this lab, you have learned a variety of Python fundamentals. You successfully verified the Python installation on your system, used the interactive interpreter for simple commands, and created basic programs that accept user input and generate ASCII art patterns. You also grasped important Python concepts such as syntax, data types, variables, and function definitions.

These skills are the foundation for Python development. You now know how to use the interactive mode for quick testing and create and run complete Python programs. To continue your Python journey, consider exploring more built - in functions and modules, learning about data structures, creating complex real - world programs, and studying object - oriented programming in Python.

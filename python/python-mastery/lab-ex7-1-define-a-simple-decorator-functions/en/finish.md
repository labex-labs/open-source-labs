# Summary

Congratulations on completing the "Define a Simple Decorator Functions" lab. You have learned:

1. What decorators are and how they work in Python
2. How to create a simple logging decorator that adds behavior to functions
3. How to build a more complex decorator that validates function arguments based on type annotations
4. How to use the `inspect` module to analyze function signatures
5. How to use `functools.wraps` to preserve function metadata

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that help you write more maintainable and reusable code. They are widely used in Python frameworks and libraries to implement cross-cutting concerns like:

- Logging and debugging
- Access control and authentication
- Caching and memoization
- Timing and profiling
- Input validation and type checking

You can now apply these techniques in your own Python projects to write cleaner and more maintainable code.

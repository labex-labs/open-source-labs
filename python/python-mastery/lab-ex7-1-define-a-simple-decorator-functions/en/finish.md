# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about decorators in Python, including what they are and how they operate. You've also mastered the creation of a simple logging decorator to add behavior to functions and built a more complex one for validating function arguments based on type annotations. Additionally, you've learned to use the `inspect` module for analyzing function signatures and `functools.wraps` to preserve function metadata.

Decorators are a powerful Python feature that enables writing more maintainable and reusable code. They are commonly used in Python frameworks and libraries for cross - cutting concerns such as logging, access control, and caching. You can now apply these techniques in your own Python projects for cleaner and more maintainable code.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn what decorators are and how they work in Python. Decorators are a powerful feature that enables you to modify function behavior without altering the source code, and they are widely used in Python frameworks and libraries.

You will also learn to create a simple logging decorator and implement a more complex one for function validation. The files involved in this lab include `logcall.py`, `sample.py`, and `validate.py`, with `validate.py` being modified.

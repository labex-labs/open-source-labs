# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Learn what decorators are and how they work in Python
- Create a simple logging decorator
- Implement a more complex decorator for function validation

In this lab, you will learn how to define and use Python decorators. Decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify the behavior of functions without changing their source code. They are widely used in Python frameworks and libraries for tasks like logging, validation, and authentication.

# Summary

In this lab, you learned about mixin classes and cooperative inheritance in Python, powerful techniques for extending class functionality without modifying existing code.

Key concepts covered:

- Understanding the limitations of single inheritance
- Creating mixin classes to add targeted functionality
- Using cooperative inheritance with `super()` to build method chains
- Combining multiple mixins to compose complex behaviors
- Creating user-friendly APIs that hide inheritance complexity

These techniques are valuable tools for writing maintainable, extensible Python code, particularly in frameworks and libraries where you need to provide customization points without forcing users to rewrite existing code.

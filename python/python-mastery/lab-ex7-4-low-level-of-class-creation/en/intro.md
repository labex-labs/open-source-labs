# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the low-level steps involved in creating a class in Python. Understanding how classes are constructed using the `type()` function provides deeper insight into Python's object-oriented features.

You will also implement custom class creation techniques. The files `validate.py` and `structure.py` will be modified during this lab, allowing you to apply your new knowledge in a practical setting.

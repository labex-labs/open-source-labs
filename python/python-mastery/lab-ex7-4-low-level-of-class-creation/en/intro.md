# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Learn about the low-level steps involved in creating a class
- Understand how classes are constructed in Python using the `type()` function
- Implement custom class creation techniques

**Files Modified:** `validate.py`, `structure.py`

In this exercise, we will explore the underlying mechanics of how Python classes are created. While most developers simply use the standard class syntax, understanding the low-level process provides deeper insight into Python's object-oriented features and can lead to more powerful programming techniques.

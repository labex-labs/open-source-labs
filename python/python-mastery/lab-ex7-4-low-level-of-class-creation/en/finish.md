# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about the low - level mechanisms of class creation in Python. First, you mastered how to manually create a class using the `type()` constructor, which requires a class name, a tuple of base classes, and a dictionary of methods. Second, you implemented a `typed_structure` function to dynamically create classes with validation capabilities.

Moreover, you used the `type()` constructor along with `globals().update()` to efficiently generate multiple similar classes, thus avoiding repetitive code. These techniques offer powerful ways to programmatically create and customize classes, useful in frameworks, libraries, and metaprogramming. Understanding these underlying mechanisms deepens your insight into Python's object - oriented features and enables more advanced programming.

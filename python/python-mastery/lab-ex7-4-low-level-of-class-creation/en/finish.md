# Summary

In this lab, you have explored the low-level mechanisms of class creation in Python:

1. You learned how to manually create a class using the `type()` constructor, which takes a name, tuple of base classes, and a dictionary of methods.

2. You implemented a `typed_structure` function that dynamically creates classes with validation capabilities.

3. You used the `type()` constructor and `globals().update()` to efficiently generate multiple similar classes, eliminating repetitive code.

These techniques provide powerful ways to create and customize classes programmatically, which can be useful in frameworks, libraries, and metaprogramming scenarios. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of class creation gives you deeper insight into Python's object-oriented features and enables more sophisticated programming approaches.

Continue exploring these concepts to further enhance your Python programming skills.

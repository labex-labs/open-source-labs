# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about attribute access in Python. You'll explore how to use functions like getattr() and setattr() to manipulate object attributes effectively.

Additionally, you will experiment with bound methods. The lab will guide you through these concepts, and you'll create a file named `tableformat.py` during the process.

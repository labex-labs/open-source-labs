# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about Python's attribute access system and how it works beneath the surface. You now understand:

- How to access object attributes using both dot notation and functions like `getattr()`, `setattr()`, `delattr()`, and `hasattr()`
- How to use `getattr()` to process objects in a generic, flexible way
- How to create a table formatter that works with any collection of objects
- What bound methods are and how they maintain a connection to their object

These concepts are fundamental to many advanced Python programming techniques, including introspection, reflection, and metaprogramming. Understanding attribute access can help you write more flexible and powerful code that can work with a wide variety of object types.

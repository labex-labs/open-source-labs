# Introduction

In Python, modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python programs. This modular approach promotes code reuse and helps organize your programs into logical components.

**Objectives:**

- Understand what Python modules are and why they are useful
- Learn how to create your own Python modules
- Practice using the import statement in different ways
- Understand the concept of a main module and when code executes

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic understanding of Python syntax and functions
- Familiarity with creating and running Python scripts

Before starting this exercise, it is recommended to restart your Python interpreter session to ensure a clean environment. If using IDLE, click on the shell window and look for the menu option "Shell > Restart Shell". If using a terminal, simply exit Python and restart the interpreter.

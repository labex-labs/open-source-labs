# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about Python modules, which are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other programs. This modular approach promotes code reuse and helps organize programs into logical components.

You will understand what Python modules are and why they are useful, learn how to create your own modules, practice using the import statement in different ways, and grasp the concept of a main module and when code executes. Prerequisites include a basic understanding of Python syntax and functions, and familiarity with creating and running Python scripts. It's recommended to restart your Python interpreter session before starting this exercise for a clean environment.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned the fundamental concepts of Python modules and how to use them for code organization. Modules are Python files with reusable code, and the import statement enables you to utilize code from other modules in your program. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern allows files to function as both importable modules and standalone scripts.

These concepts are crucial for writing maintainable Python code, especially when developing larger applications. As you continue learning Python, remember that modules help group related code, importing specific items keeps the namespace clean, and the main module pattern is a best practice. Applying these techniques will make your code more organized, maintainable, and reusable.

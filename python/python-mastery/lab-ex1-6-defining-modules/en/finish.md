# Summary

In this lab, you have learned the fundamental concepts of Python modules and how to use them to organize your code:

- **Modules** are Python files that contain code that can be imported and reused in other programs
- The **import statement** allows you to use code from other modules in your program
- Using the **if **name** == "**main**"** pattern helps you create files that work both as importable modules and standalone scripts
- Creating your own modules helps organize code and promote reuse

These concepts are foundational to writing maintainable Python code and will be essential as you develop larger applications.

As you continue learning Python, remember:

- Modules help organize related code
- Importing specific items from modules keeps your namespace clean
- The main module pattern is a Python best practice

You can apply these techniques to organize your code into logical components, making it more maintainable and reusable.

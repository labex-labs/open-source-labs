# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about advanced aspects of closures in Python. First, you explored using closures as a data structure, which can encapsulate data and enable functions to maintain state between calls without relying on classes or global variables. Second, you saw how closures can act as a code generator, generating property objects with type checking for a more functional approach to attribute validation.

You also discovered how to use the descriptor protocol and the `__set_name__` method to create elegant type - checking attributes that automatically capture their names from class definitions. These techniques showcase the power and flexibility of closures, allowing you to implement complex behaviors concisely. Understanding closures and descriptors gives you more tools for creating maintainable and robust Python code.

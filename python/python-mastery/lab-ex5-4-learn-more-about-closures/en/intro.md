# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn more about closures in Python. Closures are a powerful programming concept that enables functions to remember and access variables from their enclosing scope, even after the outer function has completed execution.

You will also understand closures as a data structure, explore them as a code generator, and discover how to implement type - checking with closures. This lab will help you uncover some of the more unusual and powerful aspects of Python closures.

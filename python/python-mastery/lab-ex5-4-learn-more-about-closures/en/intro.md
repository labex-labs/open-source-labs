# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Learn more about closures in Python
- Understand closures as a data structure
- Explore closures as a code generator
- Discover how to implement type-checking with closures

In this lab, we will explore some of the more unusual and powerful aspects of closures in Python. Closures are a powerful concept in programming that allow functions to remember and access variables from their enclosing scope, even after the outer function has finished execution.

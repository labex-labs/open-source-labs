# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to implement exception handling in Python. You'll understand how to use the logging module for better error reporting, which is crucial for debugging and maintaining your code.

You will also practice modifying the `reader.py` file to handle errors gracefully instead of crashing. This hands - on experience will enhance your ability to write robust Python programs.

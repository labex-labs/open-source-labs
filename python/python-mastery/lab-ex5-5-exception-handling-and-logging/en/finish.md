# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several key concepts about exception handling and logging in Python. First, you grasped how exceptions occur during data processing and implemented try-except blocks to handle them gracefully. You also modified code to keep processing valid data when errors arise.

Secondly, you learned about Python's logging module and its benefits over print statements. You implemented different log levels like WARNING and DEBUG and saw how to configure logging for different levels of detail. These skills are crucial for writing robust Python applications, especially when dealing with error - prone external data, building unattended applications, or developing systems that need diagnostic information. You can now apply these techniques to your Python projects for better reliability and maintainability.

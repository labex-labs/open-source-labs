# Introduction

In this lab, you'll learn how to encapsulate object internals using private attributes and implement property decorators to control attribute access. These techniques are essential for maintaining the integrity of your objects and ensuring proper data handling.

You'll also understand how to restrict attribute creation using `__slots__`. We'll modify the `stock.py` file throughout this lab to apply these concepts.

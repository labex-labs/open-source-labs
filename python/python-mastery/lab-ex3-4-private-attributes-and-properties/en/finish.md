# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several crucial Python techniques for encapsulating object internals. Firstly, you've seen how to use private attributes by prefixing them with an underscore, indicating they are internal to the class implementation. Secondly, you've learned to convert methods into properties, enabling attribute - like access to computed values and implementing validation logic.

Additionally, you've explored using property setters for validation, restricting attribute creation with `__slots__` to improve memory efficiency, and ensuring consistent type handling across the class and through inheritance. These techniques enhance the robustness, efficiency, and maintainability of your classes by enforcing encapsulation and providing clear interfaces.

# Summary

In this lab, you learned several important Python techniques for encapsulating object internals:

1. **Private Attributes**: Using a leading underscore to denote attributes that are internal to a class implementation.

2. **Properties**: Converting methods to properties to provide attribute-like access to computed values and implement validation logic.

3. **Validation with Properties**: Using property setters to enforce type and value constraints on attributes.

4. **Slots**: Restricting attribute creation and improving memory efficiency with the `__slots__` class variable.

5. **Type Reconciliation**: Ensuring consistent type handling across different parts of a class and through inheritance.

These techniques help you create more robust, efficient, and maintainable classes by enforcing encapsulation, preventing errors, and providing clear interfaces for other code to use.

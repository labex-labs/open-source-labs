# Summary

In this lab, you've learned how to use private attributes, convert methods into properties, implement property validation, use `__slots__` for memory optimization, and reconcile type validation with class variables. These techniques enhance the robustness, efficiency, and maintainability of your classes by enforcing encapsulation and providing clear interfaces.

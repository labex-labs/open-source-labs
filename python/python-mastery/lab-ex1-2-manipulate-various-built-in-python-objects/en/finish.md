Congratulations on completing the Python Built-in Objects lab. You have learned how to:

- Work with Python numbers and their methods
- Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and built-in methods
- Create and modify lists, including sorting and nested structures
- Use dictionaries for key-value storage and retrieval

These fundamental skills form the basis for more advanced Python programming. Practice these operations regularly to become more comfortable with Python's built-in data types.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned the fundamentals of working with modules in Python. You've learned how to create a Python module as a `.py` file with variables, functions, and classes, and how to import modules using the `import` statement. You also understand that Python loads modules only once per interpreter session and can use `importlib.reload()` to force reloading.

Moreover, you've explored the `sys.modules` dictionary for tracking loaded modules, used the `from module import` syntax to import specific components, and grasped the limitations of module reloading, especially with classes. These concepts are the foundation for organizing Python code into reusable components, which are essential for maintaining code structure and promoting reusability in larger applications.

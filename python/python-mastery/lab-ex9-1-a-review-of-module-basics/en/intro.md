# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the basics of modules in Python. Modules are Python files that contain definitions of functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python programs. They help organize code into logical units and make it more reusable.

By the end of this lab, you will understand how to create your own modules, import them in different ways, and understand important module loading behaviors that affect your code.

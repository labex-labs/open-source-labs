# Summary

In this lab, you have learned the fundamentals of working with modules in Python:

- Creating a Python module as a `.py` file containing variables, functions, and classes
- Importing modules using the `import` statement
- Understanding that Python only loads modules once per interpreter session
- Using `importlib.reload()` to force module reloading
- Exploring the `sys.modules` dictionary that tracks loaded modules
- Using the `from module import` syntax to import specific components
- Understanding the limitations of module reloading, especially with classes

These concepts form the foundation for organizing your Python code into reusable components. As you build larger applications, modules become essential for maintaining code structure and promoting reusability.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn the basics of Python modules. Modules are Python files with function, class, and variable definitions that can be used in other Python programs. They help organize code into logical units and enhance reusability.

By the end of this lab, you will understand how to create your own modules, import them in various ways, and grasp important module loading behaviors that impact your code.

In this lab, you will learn how to manage what happens at the `yield` statements in Python. You'll gain an understanding of how to handle the operations and behaviors associated with these statements effectively.

Additionally, you will learn about generator lifetime and exception handling in generators. The files `follow.py` and `cofollow.py` will be modified during this learning process.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned essential techniques for managing `yield` statements in Python generators and coroutines. You've explored generator lifetime management, including handling the `GeneratorExit` exception during closure or garbage collection and controlling iteration break and resume. Additionally, you've learned about exception handling in generators, such as using the `throw()` method and writing robust generators to handle exceptions gracefully.

These techniques are fundamental for building robust, maintainable Python applications. They are useful for data processing, asynchronous operations, and resource management. By properly managing generator lifetime and handling exceptions, you can create resilient systems that gracefully handle errors and clean up resources when they are no longer needed.

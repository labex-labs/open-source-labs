# Summary

In this lab, you have learned essential techniques for managing `yield` statements in Python generators and coroutines:

1. **Generator Lifetime Management**

   - How to handle the `GeneratorExit` exception when a generator is closed or garbage collected
   - How to break out of and resume generator iteration

2. **Exception Handling in Generators**

   - How to throw exceptions into generators using the `throw()` method
   - How to write robust generators that can handle exceptions gracefully

3. **Practical Applications**
   - Creating robust file monitoring systems with timeout and proper cleanup
   - Building data processing pipelines using generators and coroutines with error handling

These techniques are fundamental for building robust, maintainable Python applications that use generators for data processing, asynchronous operations, and resource management. By properly managing generator lifetime and handling exceptions, you can create resilient systems that gracefully handle errors and cleanup resources when they are no longer needed.

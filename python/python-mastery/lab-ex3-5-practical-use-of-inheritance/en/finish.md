# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several key concepts in object-oriented programming. You've mastered how to use inheritance to create extensible code, define an abstract base class as an interface, and implement concrete subclasses that inherit from a base class. Additionally, you've learned to use polymorphism for writing code that works with different types and the Factory Pattern to simplify object creation.

These concepts are powerful tools for creating maintainable and extensible code. The table formatting system you built shows how inheritance can create a flexible system. You can apply these principles to other programming tasks, making your code modular, reusable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

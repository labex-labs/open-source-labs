# Summary

Congratulations on completing the Practical Use of Inheritance lab. Through this lab, you've learned:

- How to use inheritance to create extensible code
- How to define an abstract base class as an interface
- How to implement concrete subclasses that inherit from a base class
- How to use polymorphism to write code that works with different types
- How to use the Factory Pattern to simplify object creation

These object-oriented programming concepts are powerful tools for creating maintainable and extensible code. The table formatting system you built demonstrates how inheritance can be used to create a flexible system that can be easily extended to support new output formats without modifying existing code.

You can apply these same principles to many other programming tasks, creating code that is modular, reusable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

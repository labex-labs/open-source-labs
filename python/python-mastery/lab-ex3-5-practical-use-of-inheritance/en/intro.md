# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use inheritance to write extensible code and create a practical application that outputs data in multiple formats. You'll also understand how to use abstract base classes and their concrete implementations.

Moreover, you will implement a factory pattern to simplify class selection. The file you'll modify is `tableformat.py`.

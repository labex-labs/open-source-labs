# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about decorators in Python, a powerful feature that can modify the behavior of functions and methods. Decorators are commonly used for tasks such as logging, performance measurement, access control, and type checking.

You will learn how to chain multiple decorators, create decorators that accept parameters, preserve function metadata when using decorators, and apply decorators to different types of class methods. The files you will work with are `logcall.py`, `validate.py`, and `sample.py`.

# Introduction

In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify the behavior of functions and methods. They are often used for logging, performance measurement, access control, and type checking.

In this lab, you will:

- Learn how to chain multiple decorators
- Create decorators that accept parameters
- Preserve function metadata when using decorators
- Apply decorators to different types of class methods

**Files You Will Work With:** `logcall.py`, `validate.py`, `sample.py`

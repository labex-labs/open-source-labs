# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to create and use decorators effectively. You learned to preserve function metadata with `functools.wraps`, create parameter - accepting decorators, handle multiple decorators and understand their application order. You also learned to apply decorators to different class methods and create a type - enforcement decorator that takes arguments.

These decorator patterns are commonly used in Python frameworks like Flask, Django, and pytest. Mastering decorators will enable you to write more maintainable and reusable code. To further your learning, you can explore context managers, class - based decorators, using decorators for caching, and advanced type checking with decorators.

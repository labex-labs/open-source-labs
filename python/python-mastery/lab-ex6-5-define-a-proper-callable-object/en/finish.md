# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to create proper callable objects in Python. First, you explored basic validator classes for type - checking and created a callable object using the `__call__` method. Then, you enhanced this object to perform validation based on function annotations and tackled the challenge of using callable objects as class methods.

Key concepts covered include callable objects and the `__call__` method, function annotations for type hinting, using the `inspect` module to examine function signatures, and the descriptor protocol with the `__get__` method for class methods. These techniques enable you to create powerful function wrappers for pre - and post - call processing, which is a fundamental pattern for decorators and other advanced Python features.

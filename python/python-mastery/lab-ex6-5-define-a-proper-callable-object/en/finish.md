# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create proper callable objects in Python:

1. You explored the basic validator classes that perform type checking
2. You created a callable object using the `__call__` method
3. You enhanced the callable object to perform validation based on function annotations
4. You tackled the challenge of using callable objects as methods in a class

Key concepts covered:

- Callable objects and the `__call__` method
- Function annotations for type hinting
- Using the `inspect` module to examine function signatures
- The descriptor protocol and the `__get__` method for class methods

These techniques allow you to create powerful function wrappers that can perform validation, logging, or other processing before and after calling the wrapped function. This is a powerful pattern in Python that forms the basis for decorators and other advanced features.

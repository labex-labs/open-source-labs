# Understanding Validator Classes

In this lab, we're going to build on a set of validator classes to create a callable object. Before we start building, it's important to understand the validator classes provided in the `validate.py` file. These classes will help us perform type checking, which is a crucial part of ensuring that our code works as expected.

Let's start by opening the `validate.py` file in the WebIDE. This file contains the code for the validator classes we'll be using. To open it, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
code /home/labex/project/validate.py
```

Once you've opened the file, you'll see that it contains several classes. Here's a brief overview of what each class does:

1. `Validator`: This is a base class. It has a `check` method, but currently, this method doesn't do anything. It serves as a starting point for the other validator classes.
2. `Typed`: This is a subclass of `Validator`. Its main job is to check if a value is of a specific type.
3. `Integer`, `Float`, and `String`: These are specific type validators that inherit from `Typed`. They're designed to check if a value is an integer, a float, or a string, respectively.

Now, let's see how these validator classes work in practice. We'll create a new file called `test.py` to test them. To create and open this file, run the following command:

```bash
code /home/labex/project/test.py
```

Once the `test.py` file is open, add the following code to it. This code will test the `Integer` and `String` validators:

```python
from validate import Integer, String, Float

# Test Integer validator
print("Testing Integer validator:")
try:
    Integer.check(42)
    print("✓ Integer check passed for 42")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"✗ Error: {e}")

try:
    Integer.check("Hello")
    print("✗ Integer check incorrectly passed for 'Hello'")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"✓ Correctly raised error: {e}")

# Test String validator
print("\nTesting String validator:")
try:
    String.check("Hello")
    print("✓ String check passed for 'Hello'")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"✗ Error: {e}")
```

In this code, we first import the `Integer`, `String`, and `Float` validators from the `validate.py` file. Then, we test the `Integer` validator by trying to check an integer value (`42`) and a string value (`"Hello"`). If the check passes for the integer, we print a success message. If it passes incorrectly for the string, we print an error message. If the check correctly raises a `TypeError` for the string, we print a success message. We do a similar test for the `String` validator.

After adding the code, run the test file using the following command:

```bash
python3 /home/labex/project/test.py
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
Testing Integer validator:
✓ Integer check passed for 42
✓ Correctly raised error: Expected <class 'int'>

Testing String validator:
✓ String check passed for 'Hello'
```

As you can see, these validator classes allow us to perform type checking easily. For example, when you call `Integer.check(x)`, it will raise a `TypeError` if `x` is not an integer.

Now, let's think about a practical scenario. Suppose we have a function that requires its arguments to be of specific types. Here's an example of such a function:

```python
def add(x, y):
    Integer.check(x)  # Make sure x is an integer
    Integer.check(y)  # Make sure y is an integer
    return x + y
```

This function works, but there's a problem. We have to manually add the validator checks every time we want to use type checking. This can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for larger functions or projects.

In the next steps, we'll solve this problem by creating a callable object. This object will be able to automatically apply these type checks based on function annotations. This way, we won't have to add the checks manually every time.

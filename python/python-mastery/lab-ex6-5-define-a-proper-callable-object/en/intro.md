# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about callable objects in Python. A callable object can be invoked like a function using the `object()` syntax. While Python functions are inherently callable, you can create custom callable objects by implementing the `__call__` method.

You will also learn to implement a callable object using the `__call__` method and use function annotations with callable objects for parameter validation. The file `validate.py` will be modified during this lab.

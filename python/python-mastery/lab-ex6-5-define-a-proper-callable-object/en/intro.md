# Introduction

In Python, a callable object is an object that can be "called" like a function using the parentheses syntax `object()`. Python functions are callable objects by default, but you can also make your own custom objects callable by implementing the special `__call__` method.

**Objectives:**

- Learn what callable objects are and how they work in Python
- Implement a callable object using the `__call__` method
- Use function annotations with callable objects for parameter validation

**Files Modified:** `validate.py`

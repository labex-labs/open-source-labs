# Summary

Congratulations on completing the Custom Container lab. You have successfully:

1. Explored memory allocation behavior in Python lists and dictionaries
2. Learned how to optimize memory usage by switching from row-oriented to column-oriented data storage
3. Created a custom container class that maintains the original interface while using less memory
4. Enhanced your custom container to properly handle slicing operations

These techniques are valuable when working with large datasets, as they can significantly reduce memory usage without changing the interface of your code. The ability to create custom container classes that mimic built-in Python containers but with different internal representations is a powerful tool for optimizing Python applications.

You can apply these concepts to other projects where memory efficiency is important, particularly when working with large datasets that have a regular structure.

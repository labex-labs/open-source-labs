# Summary

In this lab, you have learned several important skills. First, you explored the memory allocation behavior in Python lists and dictionaries and learned to optimize memory usage by shifting from row-oriented to column-oriented data storage. Second, you created a custom container class that maintains the original interface while using less memory and enhanced it to handle slicing operations properly.

These techniques are highly valuable for working with large datasets, as they can significantly reduce memory usage without altering your code's interface. The ability to create custom container classes mimicking built - in Python containers with different internal representations is a powerful optimization tool for Python applications. You can apply these concepts to other memory - critical projects, especially those involving large, regularly - structured datasets.

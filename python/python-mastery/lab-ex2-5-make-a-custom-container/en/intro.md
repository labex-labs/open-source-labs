# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about Python containers and memory management. You'll explore how Python handles memory for built - in data structures and discover how to create a memory - efficient custom container class.

The objectives of this lab are to examine the memory allocation behavior of Python lists and dictionaries, create a custom container class to optimize memory usage, and understand the benefits of column - oriented data storage.

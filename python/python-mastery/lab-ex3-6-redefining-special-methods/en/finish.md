# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to customize the string representation of objects using the `__repr__` method, make objects comparable with the `__eq__` method, and create a context manager using the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. These special "dunder methods" are the cornerstone of Python's object - oriented features.

Implementing these methods in your classes allows your objects to behave like built - in types and integrate smoothly with Python's language features. Special methods enable various functionalities such as custom string representations, object comparison, and context management. As you progress in Python, you'll uncover more special methods to leverage its powerful object model.

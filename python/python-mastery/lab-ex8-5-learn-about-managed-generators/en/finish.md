# Summary

In this lab, you have learned about the concept of managed generators in Python. You explored how to pause and resume generators using the `yield` statement, and built a simple task scheduler to run multiple generators concurrently. Additionally, you extended the scheduler to handle network I/O efficiently and implemented a network server capable of handling multiple connections simultaneously.

This pattern of using generators for cooperative multitasking is a powerful technique that underpins many asynchronous programming frameworks in Python, such as the built-in `asyncio` module. The approach offers several advantages, including simple sequential code, efficient non-blocking I/O handling, cooperative multitasking without multiple threads, and fine-grained control over task execution. These techniques are valuable for building high-performance network applications and systems that require efficient handling of concurrent operations.

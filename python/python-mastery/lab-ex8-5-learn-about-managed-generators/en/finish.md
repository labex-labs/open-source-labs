# Summary

In this lab, you explored the concept of managed generators in Python. You learned:

- How generators can be paused and resumed with the `yield` statement
- How to build a simple task scheduler that runs multiple generators concurrently
- How to extend the task scheduler to handle network I/O efficiently
- How to implement a network server that handles multiple connections concurrently

This pattern of using generators for cooperative multitasking is a powerful technique that forms the foundation of many asynchronous programming frameworks in Python, including the built-in `asyncio` module.

The key advantages of this approach include:

- Simple, sequential-looking code without complex callbacks
- Efficient I/O handling without blocking
- Cooperative multitasking without multiple threads
- Fine-grained control over task execution

These techniques are valuable for building high-performance network applications, web servers, and other systems that need to handle many concurrent operations efficiently.

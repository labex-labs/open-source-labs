# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about managed generators and understand how to drive them in unusual ways. You'll also build a simple task scheduler and create a network server using generators.

A generator function in Python requires external code to execute. For instance, an iteration generator runs only when iterated over with a `for` loop, and coroutines need their `send()` method called. In this lab, we'll explore practical examples of driving generators in advanced applications. The files created during this lab are `multitask.py` and `server.py`.

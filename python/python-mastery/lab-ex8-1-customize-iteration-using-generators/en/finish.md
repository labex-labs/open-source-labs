# Summary

In this lab, you've learned how to customize iteration in Python using generators. Here's what you've accomplished:

1. **Created simple generators** using the `yield` statement to produce a sequence of values
2. **Added iteration support to custom classes** by implementing the `__iter__()` method
3. **Leveraged iteration capabilities** for sequence conversions, unpacking, and comparison
4. **Built a practical generator** for monitoring a streaming data source

Generators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to create iterators with minimal code. They're particularly useful for:

- Processing large data sets efficiently
- Working with streaming data
- Creating data pipelines
- Implementing custom iteration patterns

By using generators, you can write cleaner, more memory-efficient code that clearly expresses your intent.

# Summary

In this lab, you've explored the power of metaclasses in Python by:

1. Understanding the problem of managing imports for validator types
2. Modifying the `Validator` class to automatically collect all of its subclasses
3. Creating a `StructureMeta` metaclass that injects validator types into the namespace of classes
4. Testing the implementation with a `Stock` class that no longer requires explicit imports

Metaclasses are an advanced feature in Python that allow you to customize the class creation process itself. While they should be used sparingly, they can provide elegant solutions to certain types of problems, as demonstrated in this lab.

By using a metaclass, we were able to:

- Simplify the code for defining structures with validated attributes
- Eliminate the need for explicit imports of validator types
- Create a more maintainable and elegant API

This pattern of using metaclasses to inject namespaces can be applied to other scenarios where you want to provide a simplified API for your users.

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to harness the power of metaclasses in Python. First, you understood the challenge of managing imports for validator types. Then, you modified the `Validator` class to automatically gather its subclasses and created a `StructureMeta` metaclass to inject validator types into class namespaces. Finally, you tested the implementation with a `Stock` class, eliminating the need for explicit imports.

Metaclasses, an advanced Python feature, enable customization of the class creation process. Although they should be used sparingly, they offer elegant solutions to specific problems, as shown in this lab. By using a metaclass, you simplified code for defining structures with validated attributes, removed the need for explicit validator type imports, and created a more maintainable and elegant API. This metaclass - based namespace injection pattern can be applied to other scenarios for a simplified user API.

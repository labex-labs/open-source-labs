# Introduction

Metaclasses are one of Python's most powerful and advanced features. They allow you to customize class creation itself, giving you control over how classes are defined and instantiated. In this lab, you will explore metaclasses and see them in action through practical examples.

**Objectives:**

- Understand what metaclasses are and how they work
- Implement a metaclass to solve real programming problems
- Explore the practical applications of metaclasses in Python

**Files Modified:** `structure.py`, `validate.py`

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about metaclasses, one of Python's most powerful and advanced features. Metaclasses enable you to customize class creation, giving you control over how classes are defined and instantiated. You'll explore metaclasses through practical examples.

The objectives of this lab are to understand what metaclasses are and how they work, implement a metaclass to solve real programming problems, and explore the practical applications of metaclasses in Python. The files modified in this lab are `structure.py` and `validate.py`.

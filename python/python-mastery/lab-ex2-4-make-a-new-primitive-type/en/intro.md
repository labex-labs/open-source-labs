# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Create a new primitive type in Python
- Implement essential methods for making a functional primitive type
- Learn about Python's object protocol

In most Python programs, you use built-in primitive types such as `int`, `float`, and `str` to represent data. However, Python also allows you to create your own types. The standard library includes modules like `decimal` and `fractions` that implement custom primitive types. You can create your own primitive types by understanding the underlying protocols that make Python objects work.

In this lab, you will create a new primitive type called `MutInt` (Mutable Integer), which unlike Python's immutable integers, can be modified after creation. This exercise will demonstrate the fundamental principles needed to create a fully functional primitive type in Python.

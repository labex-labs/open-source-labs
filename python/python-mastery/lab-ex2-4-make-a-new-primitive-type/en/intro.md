# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a new primitive type in Python and implement essential methods for it. You'll also gain an understanding of Python's object protocol. In most Python programs, built - in primitive types like `int`, `float`, and `str` are used to represent data. However, Python enables you to create custom types, as seen in modules like `decimal` and `fractions` in the standard library.

In this lab, you will create a new primitive type named `MutInt` (Mutable Integer). Unlike Python's immutable integers, `MutInt` can be modified after creation. This exercise will showcase the fundamental principles required to create a fully functional primitive type in Python.

# Summary

Congratulations on creating your own primitive type in Python. In this lab, you have learned:

- How to create a mutable integer class that behaves like a built-in type
- How to implement special methods to control how objects are displayed
- How to add support for mathematical operations
- How to implement comparison operations
- How to enable type conversions and make your type work in various Python contexts

These concepts are fundamental to understanding Python's object model and can be applied to create various custom types that work seamlessly with Python's built-in operations.

To extend your knowledge, you might want to:

- Implement other mathematical operations like subtraction, multiplication, etc.
- Add support for other built-in functions and operations
- Explore more complex types like custom collections

Creating custom types is a powerful feature of Python that allows you to extend the language to better suit your specific needs.

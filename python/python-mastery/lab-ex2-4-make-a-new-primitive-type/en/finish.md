# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to create your own primitive type in Python. Specifically, you've mastered creating a mutable integer class similar to built - in types, implementing special methods for object display, adding support for mathematical and comparison operations, and enabling type conversions for various Python contexts.

These concepts are essential for understanding Python's object model and can be used to create custom types that integrate well with built - in operations. To further your knowledge, consider implementing more mathematical operations, adding support for other built - in functions, and exploring complex types like custom collections. Custom types in Python are a powerful tool to extend the language for specific needs.

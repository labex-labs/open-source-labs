# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use Python generators to build efficient data processing pipelines. You completed several important tasks, such as using the `follow()` function to monitor a file for new data, creating a `Ticker` class to represent stock quotes, and constructing a multi - stage processing pipeline that reads, parses, and filters CSV data, then formats and displays the results.

The generator - based approach offers multiple advantages, including memory efficiency as data is processed on - demand, modularity allowing easy combination and reuse of pipeline components, and simplicity in expressing complex data flows. These concepts are commonly applied in real - world data processing, especially for large datasets or streaming data.

# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use Python generators to create efficient data processing pipelines. You accomplished several key tasks:

1. Used the `follow()` function to continuously monitor a file for new data
2. Created a structured `Ticker` class to represent stock quotes
3. Built a multi-stage processing pipeline that:
   - Reads and parses CSV data
   - Converts rows into structured objects
   - Filters data based on specific criteria
   - Formats and displays the results in a readable form

The generator-based approach provides several benefits:

- Memory efficiency: data is processed on-demand rather than all at once
- Modularity: pipeline components can be easily combined and reused
- Simplicity: complex data flows can be expressed clearly and concisely

These concepts are widely used in real-world applications for data processing, particularly when dealing with large datasets or streaming data that would be impractical to load entirely into memory.

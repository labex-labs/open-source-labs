# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Python generators to create efficient data processing pipelines. Generators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to produce data on-demand instead of storing everything in memory at once. You will see how generators can be connected together to create data processing workflows similar to Unix pipes.

**Objectives:**

- Understand the basics of generator-based processing pipelines
- Create data processing workflows using Python generators
- Filter and format real-time data streams

**Files Created:**

- `ticker.py`

**Prerequisite**
For this exercise, the `stocksim.py` program should be running in the background. You will use the `follow()` function that you wrote in a previous exercise.

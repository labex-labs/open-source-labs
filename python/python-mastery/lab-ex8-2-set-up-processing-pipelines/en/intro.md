# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to leverage Python generators to build efficient data processing pipelines. Generators are a potent Python feature that enables on-demand data production, eliminating the need to store all data in memory simultaneously. You'll discover how to connect generators to create data processing workflows akin to Unix pipes.

The objectives of this lab are to understand the fundamentals of generator-based processing pipelines, create data processing workflows using Python generators, and filter and format real-time data streams. The `ticker.py` file will be created during this lab. Note that for this exercise, the `stocksim.py` program should be running in the background, and you'll use the `follow()` function from a previous exercise.

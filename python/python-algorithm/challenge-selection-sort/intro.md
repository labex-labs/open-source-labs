# Selection Sort

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. It is the process of arranging data in a specific order. Selection sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and putting it at the beginning. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

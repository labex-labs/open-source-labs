  "description": "In Python, we can easily find the difference between two lists using the built-in `set()` function. However, what if we want to find the difference based on a specific function applied to each element in both lists? In this challenge, you will create a function that takes in two lists and a function, and returns the difference between the two lists after applying the provided function to each list element of both.",

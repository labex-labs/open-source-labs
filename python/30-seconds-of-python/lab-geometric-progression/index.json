  "description": "In mathematics, a geometric progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this challenge, you will create a function that initializes a list containing the numbers in the specified range where `start` and `end` are inclusive and the ratio between two terms is `step`.",

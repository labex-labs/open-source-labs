# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a Python function that converts strings from various formats to snake case. Here's what you accomplished:

1. You learned how regular expressions can be used for pattern matching and string transformation
2. You implemented a function that can handle different input formats:
   - camelCase (e.g., `camelCase` → `camel_case`)
   - PascalCase (e.g., `HelloWorld` → `hello_world`)
   - Strings with spaces (e.g., `some text` → `some_text`)
   - Strings with hyphens (e.g., `hello-world` → `hello_world`)
   - Mixed formats with various delimiters and capitalization

The key techniques you used:

- Regular expressions with capture groups using `re.sub()`
- String methods like `replace()`, `lower()`, `split()`, and `join()`
- Pattern recognition for different naming conventions

These skills are valuable for data cleaning, processing text input, and maintaining consistent coding standards. The ability to convert between different case formats is particularly useful when working with APIs or libraries that use different naming conventions.

# Introduction

In Python, snake case is a naming convention where words are separated by underscores. This naming style is commonly used for variables, functions, and other identifiers in Python. For example, `calculate_total_price` and `user_authentication` are in snake case format.

Sometimes, we may encounter strings that are in different formats like camelCase, PascalCase, or even strings with spaces and hyphens. In such situations, we need to convert these strings to snake case for consistency in our code.

In this lab, you will learn how to write a Python function that converts strings from various formats to snake case.

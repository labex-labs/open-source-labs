    "description": "An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a constant value to the previous term. For example, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. In this challenge, you will write a function that generates a list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with the given positive integer and up to the specified limit.",

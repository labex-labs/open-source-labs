  "description": "In mathematics, angles can be measured in different units such as degrees and radians. Radians are a unit of measurement for angles that are commonly used in mathematics and physics. However, sometimes we may need to convert an angle from radians to degrees to make it more understandable. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a Python function that converts an angle from radians to degrees.",

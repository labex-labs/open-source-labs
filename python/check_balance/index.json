    "description": "In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A balanced binary tree is a tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. In this challenge, we will write a Python program to check if a binary tree is balanced.",

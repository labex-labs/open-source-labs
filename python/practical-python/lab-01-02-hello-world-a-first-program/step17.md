# pass statement

Sometimes you need to specify an empty code block. The keyword `pass` is used for it.

```python
if a > b:
    pass
else:
    print('Computer says false')
```

This is also called a "no-op" statement. It does nothing. It serves as a placeholder for statements, possibly to be added later.

This is the first set of exercises where you need to create Python files and run them. From this point forward, it is assumed that you are editing files in the `~/project/` directory. To help you locate the proper place, a number of empty starter files have been created with the appropriate filenames. Look for the file `bounce.py` that's used in the first exercise.

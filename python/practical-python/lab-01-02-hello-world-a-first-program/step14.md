# Conditionals

The `if` statement is used to execute a conditional:

```python
if a > b:
    print('Computer says no')
else:
    print('Computer says yes')
```

You can check for multiple conditions by adding extra checks using `elif`.

```python
if a > b:
    print('Computer says no')
elif a == b:
    print('Computer says yes')
else:
    print('Computer says maybe')
```

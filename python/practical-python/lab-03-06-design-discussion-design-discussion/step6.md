# Exercise 3.18: Fixing existing functions

Fix the `read_portfolio()` and `read_prices()` functions in the
`report.py` file so that they work with the modified version of
`parse_csv()`. This should only involve a minor modification.
Afterwards, your `report.py` and `pcost.py` programs should work
the same way they always did.

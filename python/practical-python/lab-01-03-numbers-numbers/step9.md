# Exercise 1.9: Making an Extra Payment Calculator

Modify the program so that extra payment information can be more generally handled.
Make it so that the user can set these variables:

```python
extra_payment_start_month = 61
extra_payment_end_month = 108
extra_payment = 1000
```

Make the program look at these variables and calculate the total paid appropriately.

How much will Dave pay if he pays an extra $1000/month for 4 years starting after the first
five years have already been paid?

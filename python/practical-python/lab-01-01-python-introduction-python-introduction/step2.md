# Why was Python created?

In the words of Python's creator:

> My original motivation for creating Python was the perceived need
> for a higher level language in the Amoeba [Operating Systems]
> project. I realized that the development of system administration
> utilities in C was taking too long. Moreover, doing these things in
> the Bourne shell wouldn't work for a variety of reasons. ... So,
> there was a need for a language that would bridge the gap between C
> and the shell.
>
> - Guido van Rossum

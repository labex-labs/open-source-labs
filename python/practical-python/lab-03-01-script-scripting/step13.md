Python makes it very easy to write relatively unstructured scripting code
where you just have a file with a sequence of statements in it. In the
big picture, it's almost always better to utilize functions whenever
you can. At some point, that script is going to grow and you'll wish
you had a bit more organization. Also, a little known fact is that Python
runs a bit faster if you use functions.

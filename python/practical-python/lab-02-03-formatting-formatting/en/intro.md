# Introduction

This section is a slight digression, but when you work with data, you often want to produce structured output (tables, etc.). For example:

```code
      Name      Shares        Price
----------  ----------  -----------
        AA         100        32.20
       IBM          50        91.10
       CAT         150        83.44
      MSFT         200        51.23
        GE          95        40.37
      MSFT          50        65.10
       IBM         100        70.44
```

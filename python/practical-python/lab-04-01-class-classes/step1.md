# Object Oriented (OO) programming

A Programming technique where code is organized as a collection of
_objects_.

An _object_ consists of:

- Data. Attributes
- Behavior. Methods which are functions applied to the object.

You have already been using some OO during this course.

For example, manipulating a list.

```python
>>> nums = [1, 2, 3]
>>> nums.append(4)      # Method
>>> nums.insert(1,10)   # Method
>>> nums
[1, 10, 2, 3, 4]        # Data
>>>
```

`nums` is an _instance_ of a list.

Methods (`append()` and `insert()`) are attached to the instance (`nums`).

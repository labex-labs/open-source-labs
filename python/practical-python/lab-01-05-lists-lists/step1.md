# Creating a List

Use square brackets to define a list literal:

```python
names = [ 'Elwood', 'Jake', 'Curtis' ]
nums = [ 39, 38, 42, 65, 111]
```

Sometimes lists are created by other methods. For example, a string can be split into a
list using the `split()` method:

```python
>>> line = 'GOOG,100,490.10'
>>> row = line.split(',')
>>> row
['GOOG', '100', '490.10']
>>>
```

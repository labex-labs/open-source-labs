# Exercise 1.21: Membership tests

Use the `in` or `not in` operator to check if `'AIG'`,`'AA'`, and `'CAT'` are in the list of symbols.

```python
>>> # Is 'AIG' IN the `symlist`?
True
>>> # Is 'AA' IN the `symlist`?
False
>>> # Is 'CAT' NOT IN the `symlist`?
True
>>>
```

Here's a solution:
```python
AIG in symlist
AA in symlist
CAT not in symlist
```

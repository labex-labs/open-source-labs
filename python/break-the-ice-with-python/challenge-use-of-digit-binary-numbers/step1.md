# Use of Digit Binary Numbers

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
0100,0011,1010,1001
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
1010
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.

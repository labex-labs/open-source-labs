# Print Even Numbers

Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

## Example

If the following n is given as input to the program:

```bash
10
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
0,2,4,6,8,10
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- Use `yield` to produce the next value in generator.

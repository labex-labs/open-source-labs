# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to customize spines in Matplotlib. Spines are the lines that connect the axis tick marks and demarcate the boundaries of the data area. By default, Matplotlib displays spines on all four sides of the plot. However, you may want to customize these spines to better highlight your data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

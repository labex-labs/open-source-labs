# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to add angle annotations to bracket arrow styles created using `FancyArrowPatch` in Matplotlib. Angle annotations are useful for indicating the direction and size of angles in a plot. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create bracket arrow styles with angle annotations and customize them to fit your specific needs.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through how to apply font effects to your Matplotlib plots using the usetex mode. We will use a sample script that demonstrates font effects specified in the pdftex.map file. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create professional-looking plots with custom font effects.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

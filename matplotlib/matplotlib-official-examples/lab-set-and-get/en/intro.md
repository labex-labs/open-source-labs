# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It allows you to create a wide range of visualizations such as line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and 3D plots. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the pyplot interface to set and get object properties for visualizing data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

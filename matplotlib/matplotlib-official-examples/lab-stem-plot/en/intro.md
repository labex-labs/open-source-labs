# Introduction

The stem plot is a type of plot used in data visualization. It is used to plot vertical lines from a baseline to the y-coordinate and places a marker at the tip. In this lab, we will learn how to use the stem plot function in Python's Matplotlib library.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

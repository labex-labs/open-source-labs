# Introduction

This lab will guide you on how to create a scatter plot with histograms using Matplotlib. A scatter plot with histograms is a great way to visualize the distribution of two variables and their relationship. The scatter plot displays the relationship between the two variables, while the histograms show the distribution of each variable independently.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

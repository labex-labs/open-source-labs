# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the basic usage of the `errorbar()` function in Matplotlib. The `errorbar()` function is used to plot error bars on a graph. Error bars indicate the variability or uncertainty of a data point in a graph. The function can be used to plot error bars in both the x- and y-directions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

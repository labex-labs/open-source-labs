# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of using the agg backend directly to create images in Python Matplotlib. The agg backend is useful for web application developers who want full control over their code without using the pyplot interface to manage figures, figure closing, etc. In this lab, we will show you how to save the contents of the agg canvas to a file and how to extract them to a numpy array, which can in turn be passed off to Pillow.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

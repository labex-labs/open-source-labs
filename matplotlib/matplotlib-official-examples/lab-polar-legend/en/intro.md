# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a polar plot with a legend using Python Matplotlib. Polar plots are used to plot data in polar coordinates, which is useful when working with directional data. Legends are used to explain the meaning of the different lines or markers on a plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

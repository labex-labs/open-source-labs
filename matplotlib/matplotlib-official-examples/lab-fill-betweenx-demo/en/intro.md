# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python. It provides a wide variety of tools to create complex and customizable plots, charts, and graphs. One of the most useful tools provided by Matplotlib is the `fill_betweenx` function. This function is used to fill the area between two horizontal curves. In this tutorial, we will explore the `fill_betweenx` function and learn how to use it to create different types of plots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

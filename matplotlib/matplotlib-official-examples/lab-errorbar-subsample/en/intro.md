# Introduction

In data visualization, it is sometimes useful to plot error bars to show the uncertainty or variability of the data. However, if there are many data points with similar errors, the plot can become cluttered and difficult to interpret. In such cases, we can use errorbar subsampling, which allows us to draw error bars only on a subset of data points. In this tutorial, we will use Matplotlib's `errorbar` function to demonstrate how to apply errorbar subsampling to our data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will demonstrate how to use filtering effects with Matplotlib's pie chart. We will use the pie chart drawing code borrowed from pie_demo.py and add filtering effects to the chart. The filtering effects are only effective if your SVG renderer supports it.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

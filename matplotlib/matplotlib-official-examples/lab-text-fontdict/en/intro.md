# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to control the style of text and labels in a Matplotlib plot using a dictionary. By creating a dictionary of options, we can share parameters across multiple text objects and labels. This will allow us to easily customize the font family, color, weight, and size of text in our plots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

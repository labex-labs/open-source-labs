# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of antialiasing an image using Matplotlib in Python. Antialiasing is a technique used to smooth out jagged edges and reduce distortion in images. In this tutorial, we will use Matplotlib to generate a 450x450 pixel image with varying frequency content. We will then subsample the image from 450 data pixels to either 125 pixels or 250 pixels to demonstrate how antialiasing can be used to reduce the Moir√© patterns caused by high-frequency data being subsampled.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

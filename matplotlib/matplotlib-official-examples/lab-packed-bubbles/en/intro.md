# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a packed-bubble chart using Matplotlib in Python. The packed-bubble chart is a type of chart that displays data in bubbles of different sizes, with the bubble's size representing the data's magnitude. This chart is useful for displaying scalar data, where the data is a single numeric value associated with an item.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

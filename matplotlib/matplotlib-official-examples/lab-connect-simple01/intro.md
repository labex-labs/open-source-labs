# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It provides a variety of visualization tools to create stunning graphics and charts. In this lab, we will learn about ConnectionPatch, which is used to draw a line between points defined in different coordinate systems and/or axes.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a plot with two y-axes using Matplotlib. The plot will display two sets of data with different units of measurement on different scales. This type of plot is commonly used in scientific research to visualize relationships between variables that are not directly comparable.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

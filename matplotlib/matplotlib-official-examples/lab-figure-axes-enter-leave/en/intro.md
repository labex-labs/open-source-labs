# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for Python. It offers a variety of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. One of the interactive features of Matplotlib is the ability to detect when the mouse enters and leaves a figure or an axes. In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib's Figure and Axes enter/leave events to change the frame colors of the figure and axes.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an Ishikawa diagram, also known as a fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram. Ishikawa diagrams are commonly used to identify problems in a system by showing how causes and effects are linked. We will use Python and the Matplotlib library to create the diagram.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

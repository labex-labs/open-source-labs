# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library for Python. It provides a number of built-in scales for plotting data, but sometimes you may need a custom scale for your specific use case. In this lab, we will show you how to create a custom scale that uses the Mercator projection for latitude data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

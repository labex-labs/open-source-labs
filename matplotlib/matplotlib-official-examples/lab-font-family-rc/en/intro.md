# Introduction

In Matplotlib, it is possible to configure the font family and style used in plots and visualizations. This is useful for ensuring consistency in the appearance of text across multiple plots and for ensuring that text is legible and easy to read. In this lab, we will explore how to configure the font family and style in Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

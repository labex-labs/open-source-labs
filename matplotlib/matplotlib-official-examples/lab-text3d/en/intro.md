# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to place text annotations on a 3D plot using Matplotlib library in Python. The following functionalities will be covered:

- Using the `~.Axes3D.text` function with three types of _zdir_ values: None, an axis name (ex. 'x'), or a direction tuple (ex. (1, 1, 0)).
- Using the `~.Axes3D.text` function with the color keyword.
- Using the `.text2D` function to place text on a fixed position on the ax object.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create and plot unstructured triangular grids in Python using the Matplotlib library. We will start by creating a Delaunay triangulation of a set of points and then plot the triangulation. Next, we will specify our own triangulation by providing the indices of the three points that make up each triangle. Finally, we will plot the user-specified triangulation.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library that enables the creation of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more. In this lab, you will learn how to plot images using Matplotlib and how to manipulate the location of axes and colorbars.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In data visualization, contour plots are commonly used to display 3-dimensional data on a 2-dimensional plane. Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library in Python that provides functionalities to create different types of plots, including contour plots. In this lab, we will learn how to create masked contour plots using Matplotlib and how to illustrate the difference between corner masks being enabled and disabled.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

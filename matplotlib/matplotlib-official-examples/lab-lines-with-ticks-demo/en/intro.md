# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to add ticks along a line in Matplotlib using Ticked Patheffect. Ticks can be added to mark one side as a barrier and you can control the angle, spacing, and length of the ticks. Ticks will also appear appropriately in the legend.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

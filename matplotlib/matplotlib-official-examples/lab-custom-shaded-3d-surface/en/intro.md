# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use custom hillshading in a 3D surface plot using Python Matplotlib. Hillshading is the use of light and shadow to enhance the perception of depth and relief in a 3D plot. By customizing the hillshading, we can create a more visually appealing and informative plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D histogram of 2D data using Python Matplotlib. A histogram is a graphical representation of data that groups a range of values into bins, and the 3D histogram extends this concept by adding a third dimension to the visualization.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

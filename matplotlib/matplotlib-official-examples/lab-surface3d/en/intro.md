# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to plot a 3D surface using Matplotlib in Python. The 3D surface is colored with the coolwarm colormap and made opaque by using "antialiased=False". The tutorial also demonstrates using the `.LinearLocator` and custom formatting for the z axis tick labels.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

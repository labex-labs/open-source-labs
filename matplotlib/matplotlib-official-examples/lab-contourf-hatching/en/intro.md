# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create filled contour plots with hatched patterns using Python's Matplotlib library. Contour plots are used to display three-dimensional data in two dimensions. They are particularly useful for visualizing data that has peaks and valleys, such as topographical data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

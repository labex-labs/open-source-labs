# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to create a 3D stem plot using the Matplotlib library in Python. A stem plot is a way of plotting data points by drawing vertical lines from a baseline to the data point and placing a marker at the tip.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

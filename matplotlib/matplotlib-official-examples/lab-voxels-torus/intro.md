# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D voxel plot using cylindrical coordinates in Matplotlib. The plot will demonstrate how to use the _x_, _y_, and _z_ parameters of `.Axes3D.voxels` to create a 3D voxel plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

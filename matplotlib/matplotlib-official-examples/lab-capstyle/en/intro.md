# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the `CapStyle` parameter in Matplotlib. This parameter controls how Matplotlib draws the corners where two different line segments meet. We will go through a step-by-step process to understand the different `CapStyle` options and how to implement them.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

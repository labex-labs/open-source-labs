# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of plotting the Power Spectral Density (PSD) using the Matplotlib library in Python. The PSD is a plot commonly used in the field of signal processing. NumPy has many useful libraries for computing a PSD, and we will show a few examples of how this can be accomplished and visualized with Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

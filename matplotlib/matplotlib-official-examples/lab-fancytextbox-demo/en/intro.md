# Introduction

In data visualization, it is important to highlight specific information to draw the viewer's attention. One way to do this is by styling text boxes using bbox parameters in Matplotlib. In this lab, we will learn how to style text boxes using bbox parameters in Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

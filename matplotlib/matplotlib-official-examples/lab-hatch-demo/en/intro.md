# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use hatches in Python Matplotlib to add texture to your plots. Hatches are patterns that are used to fill the area of a plot. You can use hatches to differentiate between different parts of your plot or to add visual interest to your plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

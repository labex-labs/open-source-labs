# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides many tools to create different types of plots and graphs. One of the useful features of Matplotlib is the ability to zoom in on a particular region of a plot, which can help to analyze data more closely. In this lab, we will learn how to create a zoomed inset using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

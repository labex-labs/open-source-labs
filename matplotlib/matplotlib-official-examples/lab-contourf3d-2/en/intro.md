# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a 3D surface graph with filled contour profiles projected onto the walls of the graph. This is a useful visualization technique for understanding complex 3D data. We will be using Python's Matplotlib library to create the graph.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

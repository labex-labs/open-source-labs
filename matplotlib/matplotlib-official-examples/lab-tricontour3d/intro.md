# Introduction

In this lab, we will create a triangular 3D contour plot using Matplotlib. This plot is useful for visualizing unstructured triangular grids. We will be using the same data as in the second plot of trisurf3d_2.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

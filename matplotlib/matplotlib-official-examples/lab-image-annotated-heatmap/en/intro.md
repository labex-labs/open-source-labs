# Introduction

In data analysis, we often want to display data that depends on two independent variables as a color-coded image plot known as a heatmap. In this lab, we will use Matplotlib's `imshow` function to create a heatmap with annotations. We will start with a simple example and expand it to be usable as a universal function.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

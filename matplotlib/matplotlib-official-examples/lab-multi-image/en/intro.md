# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of making a set of images with a single colormap, norm, and colorbar in Python's Matplotlib library. You will learn how to generate data, set color scales, and update images to respond to changes in the norm of other images.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the use of cross-correlation and auto-correlation plots using the Python Matplotlib library. Cross-correlation and auto-correlation are mathematical tools used to measure the similarity between two signals. Cross-correlation measures the similarity between two different signals, while auto-correlation measures the similarity between a signal and a time-delayed version of itself. These tools are commonly used in signal processing, image analysis, and time series analysis.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

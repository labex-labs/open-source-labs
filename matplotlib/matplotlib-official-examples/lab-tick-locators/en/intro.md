# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to define the position of ticks in a matplotlib plot using tick locators. Tick locators help to make plots more readable by defining the position of the ticks on the x and y-axes. We will cover different types of tick locators and how to implement them in a matplotlib plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab is designed to teach you how to create an animated scatter plot using Python's Matplotlib library. We will cover everything from setting up the plot to saving the animation as a GIF. By the end of this lab, you will have a working animated scatter plot that you can use to visualize your data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

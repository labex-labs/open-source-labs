# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create violin plots using Matplotlib library in Python. Violin plots are used to visualize the distribution of a dataset. These plots are similar to box plots, but instead of showing only the summary statistics, violin plots show the full distribution of the data.

We will use a sample dataset to create violin plots and modify various parameters to observe changes in the plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a graph of multiple time series that demonstrates custom styling of plot frame, tick lines, tick labels, and line graph properties using Matplotlib. The graph will display stock prices of various companies over a period of 32 years.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

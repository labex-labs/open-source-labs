# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a plot with custom fonts using the Python Matplotlib library. You will be introduced to the `pgf.texsystem` parameter that allows you to use LaTeX to customize the font family of your plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

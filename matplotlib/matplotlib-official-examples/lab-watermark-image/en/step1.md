# Creating a Jupyter Notebook and Importing Required Libraries

In the first cell of your notebook, enter the following code to import the necessary libraries:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
import matplotlib.image as image
```

Let's understand what each of these libraries does:

- `matplotlib.pyplot` (aliased as `plt`): A collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB, providing a convenient interface for creating plots.
- `numpy` (aliased as `np`): A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, which we'll use for data manipulation.
- `matplotlib.cbook`: A collection of utility functions for matplotlib, including functions to get sample data.
- `matplotlib.image`: A module for image-related functionality in matplotlib, which we'll use to read and display images.

4. Run the cell by clicking the "Run" button at the top of the notebook or by pressing Shift+Enter.

This cell execution should complete without any output, indicating that all libraries were successfully imported.

# Introduction

In data visualization, sometimes you may want to add a logo, watermark, or other image elements to your plots. This tutorial demonstrates how to overlay an image on a Matplotlib plot by placing it in front of the plot content and making it semi-transparent.

You will learn how to use the `figimage` method from the `matplotlib.figure.Figure` class to position an image on your plot, and the `imread` method from the `matplotlib.image` module to load image data.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create professional-looking visualizations with custom image overlays that can be useful for branding, watermarking, or enhancing the visual appeal of your data presentations.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

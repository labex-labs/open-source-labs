# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to customize the axis tick and grid properties in a Matplotlib plot using Python. Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that allows you to create a variety of charts and graphs. In this lab, we will focus on customizing the axis tick and grid properties of a line plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a horizontal bar chart using Python's Matplotlib library. We will use the example of gym teachers wanting to show parents how their child did across a handful of fitness tests, relative to other children. We will make up some data for little Johnny Doe to extract the plotting code for demo purposes.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to set the behavior of tick auto-placement in Matplotlib. By default, Matplotlib will choose the number of ticks and tick positions so that there is a reasonable number of ticks on the axis and they are located at "round" numbers. However, there may be no ticks on the edges of the plot. We will learn how to switch the `axes.autolimit_mode` to 'round_numbers' to keep ticks at round numbers and also have ticks at the edges.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

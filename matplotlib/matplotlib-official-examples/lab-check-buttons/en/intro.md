# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to use check buttons in Python Matplotlib. Check buttons allow users to turn visual elements on and off with check buttons, similar to check boxes. We will use the `CheckButtons` function to create a plot with three different sine waves, and the ability to choose which waves are displayed with the check buttons.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

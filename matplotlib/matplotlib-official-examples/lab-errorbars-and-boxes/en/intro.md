# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create box plots from error bars using PatchCollection. Box plots are useful for displaying the range and distribution of data. By adding a rectangle patch defined by the limits of the bars in both the x- and y-directions, we can make a more visually appealing error bar plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

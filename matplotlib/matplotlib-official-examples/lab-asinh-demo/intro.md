# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It provides a variety of tools for creating a wide range of graphs, charts, and plots. One of the most powerful features of Matplotlib is its ability to scale data. This lab will introduce you to the AsinhScale, which is a transformation that allows for plotting quantities that cover a very wide dynamic range that includes both positive and negative values.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

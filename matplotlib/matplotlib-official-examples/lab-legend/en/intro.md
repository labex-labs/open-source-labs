# Introduction

In data visualization, a legend is a key to interpreting the visual elements of a plot. It helps the viewer to understand the data and the meaning of the visual representation. Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating data visualizations, including plots with legends. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a legend with pre-defined labels in Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

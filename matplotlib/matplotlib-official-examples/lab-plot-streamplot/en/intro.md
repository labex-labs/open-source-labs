# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a streamplot using Matplotlib in Python. Streamplot is a 2D vector field that displays a set of streamlines. It is used to visualize fluid flow and other vector fields. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a streamplot with varying density, color, and line width along with controlling the starting points of streamlines.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

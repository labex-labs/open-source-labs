# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create an interactive game of Pong using Matplotlib. Pong is a classic arcade game that involves two players hitting a ball back and forth across a virtual playing field using paddles. This lab will guide you through the process of building your own Pong game using Python and Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating custom fill colors for box plots using Python Matplotlib. Box plots are a type of graph used to display the distribution of a set of data. They show the median, quartiles, and outliers of the data set. In this tutorial, we will use the `boxplot()` function in Matplotlib to create two types of box plots (rectangular and notched) and fill them with custom colors.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

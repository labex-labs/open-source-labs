# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to interactively adjust the range of colormapping on an image using a colorbar. You will use the zoom and pan mode to adjust the vmin and vmax of the norm. Zooming using the right mouse button will expand the vmin and vmax proportionally to the selected region. When panning, the vmin and vmax of the norm are both shifted according to the direction of movement. You can also use the Home/Back/Forward buttons to get back to a previous state.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use `transforms.offset_copy` to position a drawing element, such as a text string, at a specified offset in screen coordinates relative to a location given in any coordinates. We will use the Matplotlib library in Python to create a scatter plot and a polar plot, and then add text to each plot using `offset_copy`.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

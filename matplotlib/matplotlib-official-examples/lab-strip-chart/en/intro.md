# Introduction

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide on how to create an oscilloscope using Python's Matplotlib library. An oscilloscope is a device used to measure and display voltage signals over time. In this tutorial, we will use Matplotlib's animation module to create a real-time display of a voltage signal.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

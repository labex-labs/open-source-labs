# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a simple axis line using Matplotlib. We will use the mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axislines library to create an axis line with x and y axis labels, and a y2 axis label on the right side. We will also learn how to hide the top and right axes, and make the x axis line visible at y=0.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

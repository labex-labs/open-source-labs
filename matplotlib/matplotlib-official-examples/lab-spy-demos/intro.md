# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to plot sparsity patterns of arrays using Matplotlib. The sparsity pattern refers to the distribution of non-zero elements in an array. We will use the `spy` function in Matplotlib to plot the sparsity patterns.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

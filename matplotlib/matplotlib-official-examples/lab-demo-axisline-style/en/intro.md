# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to configure axis style in Matplotlib. We will be using the `mpl_toolkits.axisartist` axes classes to add arrows at the ends of each axis and to add X and Y-axis from the origin. We will also hide the borders of the plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Matplotlib is a widely used data visualization library in Python. It provides a variety of tools to create different types of plots, including subplots. When creating subplots, it is often helpful to label each plot to make it easier for the reader to understand the information being presented. In this lab, we will learn how to label subplots using different methods provided by Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

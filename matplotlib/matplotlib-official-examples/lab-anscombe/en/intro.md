# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to create visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python used to create a variety of charts and graphs. With Matplotlib, you can create line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and many other types of visualizations.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. A contour plot is a graphical representation of the relationship between three variables. It is used to display the relationship between two variables on the x and y axes and the third variable on the z-axis. Contour plots are widely used in scientific and engineering fields to display data in a 3D space.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This tutorial lab will guide you through using Matplotlib in a Flask web application server. You will learn how to create figures using the `.Figure` constructor and save them to in-memory buffers, embed the resulting figures in HTML output, and run the Flask application using the `flask` command-line tool.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

When creating data visualizations, adding annotations can greatly enhance the viewer's understanding of your plots. Text boxes are an effective way to include additional information directly within your visualizations. Matplotlib, a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, offers powerful tools for adding customizable text boxes to your plots.

In this lab, you will learn how to place text boxes in Matplotlib plots using Python. You will discover how to position text in axes coordinates, which keeps the text in a fixed position relative to the plot, regardless of changes to data scales. Additionally, you will learn how to customize text boxes with different styles, colors, and transparency levels using the `bbox` property.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create informative and visually appealing plots with strategically placed annotations for your data visualization projects.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is complete, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

You may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. Due to limitations in Jupyter Notebook, the validation of operations cannot be automated.

If you encounter any issues during the lab, feel free to ask Labby for assistance. We appreciate your feedback after the session to help us improve the lab experience.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a Hat Graph in Python using the Matplotlib library. A Hat Graph is a variant of a stacked bar chart, where each bar is a hat shape. We will use a dataset of scores by number of game and players to create the graph.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

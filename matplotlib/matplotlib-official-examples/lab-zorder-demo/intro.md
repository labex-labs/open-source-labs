# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about the drawing order of artists in Matplotlib and how to adjust the order using the `zorder` attribute. We will also explore how to change the order for individual artists and the default value of `zorder` for different types of artists.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

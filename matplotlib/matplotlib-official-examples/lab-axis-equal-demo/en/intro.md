# Introduction

In data visualization, it is important to present information in an accurate and visually appealing way. One way to achieve this is by setting equal axis aspect ratios in plots. This ensures that the x and y axes are scaled equally, resulting in a proportional representation of the data. In this tutorial, we will learn how to set and adjust plots with equal axis aspect ratios using Python's Matplotlib library.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

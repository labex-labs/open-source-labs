# Customizing your Histogram

Customizing a 2D histogram is similar to the 1D case, you can control visual components such as the bin size or color normalization.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(5, 15), sharex=True, sharey=True,
                        tight_layout=True)

# We can increase the number of bins on each axis
axs[0].hist2d(dist1, dist2, bins=40)

# As well as define normalization of the colors
axs[1].hist2d(dist1, dist2, bins=40, norm=colors.LogNorm())

# We can also define custom numbers of bins for each axis
axs[2].hist2d(dist1, dist2, bins=(80, 10), norm=colors.LogNorm())

plt.show()
```

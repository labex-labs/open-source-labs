# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to draw an ellipse with an orientation arrow using Matplotlib. Ellipses are a type of shape that are commonly used in data visualization to represent data. By adding an orientation arrow to an ellipse, you can provide additional information about the direction of the data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

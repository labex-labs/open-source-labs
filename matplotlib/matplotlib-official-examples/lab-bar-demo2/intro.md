# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the step-by-step process of creating a bar graph using Python's Matplotlib library. The example in this tutorial shows how to use the default units of centimeters and inches, how to set the x and y units using various keywords, and how to set the x-limits using scalars or units.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

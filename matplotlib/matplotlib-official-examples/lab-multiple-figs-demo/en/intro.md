# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to manage multiple figures in Matplotlib's pyplot. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python, and pyplot is a sub-library within Matplotlib that provides a simple interface for creating, customizing, and organizing plots. You will learn how to create and switch between multiple figures, create subplots within each figure, and make changes to specific subplots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

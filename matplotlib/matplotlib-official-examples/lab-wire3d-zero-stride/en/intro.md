# Introduction

This lab is designed to show you how to create a 3D wireframe plot in Python using Matplotlib. A wireframe plot is a visual representation of a three-dimensional surface that displays the structure of the surface using lines. In this lab, we will show how to set the `rstride` and `cstride` parameters to control the density of the lines in the plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

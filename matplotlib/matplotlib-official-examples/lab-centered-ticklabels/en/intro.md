# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to center labels between ticks in a Matplotlib plot using Python. By default, tick labels are aligned relative to their associated tick, but there is no direct way to center the labels between ticks. However, we can place a label on the minor ticks in between the major ticks and hide the major tick labels and minor ticks to fake this behavior. We will use financial data for Google's stock price to demonstrate this technique.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

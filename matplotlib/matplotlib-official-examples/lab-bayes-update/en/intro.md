# Introduction

Bayesian updating is a statistical approach that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis as new data becomes available. In this lab, we will use Matplotlib to create an animation that shows how Bayesian updating works. Specifically, we will simulate a coin toss experiment and use Bayesian updating to estimate the probability of the coin landing heads up.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. In this lab, we will be using Matplotlib to create a polygon programmatically or interactively. The polygon can be used to highlight a region of interest or to mask out a certain area of a plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

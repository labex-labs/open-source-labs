# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating annotation connection styles using the Matplotlib library in Python. Annotations are an important tool in data visualization as they help to explain or highlight specific data points on a graph. The connection style of an annotation refers to the shape and style of the line connecting the annotation to the data point.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

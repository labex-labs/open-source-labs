# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a custom grid of axes with Matplotlib using the `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` module. We will create two examples: one with fixed axes sizes and paddings, and another with scalable axes sizes and fixed paddings.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

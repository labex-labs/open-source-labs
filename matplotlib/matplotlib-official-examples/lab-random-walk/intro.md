# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an animated 3D random walk plot using Matplotlib library in Python. We will create a 3D plot and simulate a random walk with 40 particles that move randomly in 3D space.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

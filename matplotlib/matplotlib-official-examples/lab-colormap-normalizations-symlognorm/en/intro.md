# Introduction

In data visualization, colormaps are used to represent numerical data through color. However, sometimes the data distribution may be nonlinear, which can make it difficult to discern the details of the data. In such cases, colormap normalization can be used to map colormaps onto data in nonlinear ways to help visualize the data more accurately. Matplotlib provides several normalization methods, including `SymLogNorm` and `AsinhNorm`, which can be used to normalize colormaps. This lab will demonstrate how to use `SymLogNorm` and `AsinhNorm` to map colormaps onto nonlinear data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

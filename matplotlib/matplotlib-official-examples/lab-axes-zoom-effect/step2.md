# Defining the Connection Between the Axes

In this step, we will define the connection between the two axes. This function takes in two axes as inputs, as well as the minimum and maximum values for the x-axis. It then creates a bounding box and connects the two axes.

```python
def zoom_effect01(ax1, ax2, xmin, xmax, **kwargs):
    bbox = Bbox.from_extents(xmin, 0, xmax, 1)

    mybbox1 = TransformedBbox(bbox, ax1.get_xaxis_transform())
    mybbox2 = TransformedBbox(bbox, ax2.get_xaxis_transform())

    prop_patches = {**kwargs, "ec": "none", "alpha": 0.2}

    c1, c2, bbox_patch1, bbox_patch2, p = connect_bbox(
        mybbox1, mybbox2,
        loc1a=3, loc2a=2, loc1b=4, loc2b=1,
        prop_lines=kwargs, prop_patches=prop_patches)

    ax1.add_patch(bbox_patch1)
    ax2.add_patch(bbox_patch2)
    ax2.add_patch(c1)
    ax2.add_patch(c2)
    ax2.add_patch(p)

    return c1, c2, bbox_patch1, bbox_patch2, p
```

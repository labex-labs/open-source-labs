# Introduction

In this step-by-step lab, we will be learning how to create a simple axis direction in Python Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that allows you to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python programming. We will be using the library to create a simple axis direction diagram using the following steps.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

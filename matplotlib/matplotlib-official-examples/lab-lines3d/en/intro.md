# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to plot a parametric curve in 3D using Matplotlib. The curve will be defined by three equations:

x = r \* sin(theta)

y = r \* cos(theta)

z = z

where r and z are defined as:

r = z^2 + 1

z is a range of values from -2 to 2, and theta is a range of values from -4π to 4π.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

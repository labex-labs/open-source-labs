# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create log-log plots using Matplotlib in Python. A log-log plot is a type of graph where both the x-axis and y-axis are logarithmically scaled. This allows us to visualize data that spans several orders of magnitude in a compact and informative way.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

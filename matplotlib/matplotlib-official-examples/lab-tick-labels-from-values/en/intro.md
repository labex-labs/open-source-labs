# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to create tick labels from a list of values. When using `.Axes.set_xticks`, the tick labels are set on the currently chosen ticks. However, sometimes it is better to allow Matplotlib to dynamically choose the number of ticks and their spacing. In this case, you may want to determine the tick label from the value at the tick. This tutorial will show you how to do this.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

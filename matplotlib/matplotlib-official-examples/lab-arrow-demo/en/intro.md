# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python. It provides a variety of customizable visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar graphs, histograms, and more. One of the visualizations that Matplotlib provides is the Arrow Plot. Arrow plots are used to encode arrow "strength" such as transition probabilities in a Markov model using arrow length, width, or alpha (opacity).

In this lab, we will learn how to create arrow plots using Matplotlib. We will use the `make_arrow_graph()` function to plot the arrow graph.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of annotating a plot using Matplotlib. Annotating a plot is a useful way to highlight specific features or data points on a graph. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to annotate a plot with an arrow pointing to provided coordinates.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

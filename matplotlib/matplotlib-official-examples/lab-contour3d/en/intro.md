# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib library in Python. A contour plot is a graphical representation of a 3D surface in which contours are plotted on a 2D plane. Contour plots are useful to visualize the variation of a variable with respect to two other variables.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

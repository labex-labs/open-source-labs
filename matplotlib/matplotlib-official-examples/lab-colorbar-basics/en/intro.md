# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `matplotlib` library to create colorbars for visualizations. Colorbars are a useful tool to help interpret visualizations, by providing a color scale that corresponds to the data being plotted. We will use `matplotlib` to create colorbars for visualizations with both positive and negative data values.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to customize box plots in Matplotlib. Box plots are a popular way to visualize the distribution of a dataset. They are also known as box-and-whisker plots and show the median, quartiles, and outliers of the data. We will go through various examples to learn how to customize box plots using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

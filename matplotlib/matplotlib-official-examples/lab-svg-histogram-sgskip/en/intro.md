# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an interactive histogram using Matplotlib. The interactivity is encoded in ECMAScript (JavaScript) and inserted in the SVG code in a post-processing step. The resulting histogram will have bars that can be hidden or shown by clicking on legend markers.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

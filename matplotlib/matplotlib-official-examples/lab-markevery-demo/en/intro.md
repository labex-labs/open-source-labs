# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the `markevery` property of `Line2D` to draw markers at a subset of data points in Matplotlib. We will cover various ways to specify the markers, including using integers, tuples, lists, slices, and floats. We will also explore how `markevery` behaves with linear and logarithmic scales, as well as with zoomed and polar plots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

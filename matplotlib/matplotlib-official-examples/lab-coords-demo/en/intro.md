# Introduction

This lab demonstrates an example of how to interact with the plotting canvas by connecting to move and click events using Matplotlib library in Python. Matplotlib is a data visualization library that allows users to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

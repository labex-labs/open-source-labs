# Introduction

In data visualization, zooming in on a specific area of a plot can be extremely useful to better understand and analyze the data. Matplotlib, a popular data visualization library for Python, provides a way to create two identical panels and zoom in on the right panel to show a rectangle in the first panel, denoting the zoomed region. In this lab, we will learn how to create this interactive zooming feature in Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

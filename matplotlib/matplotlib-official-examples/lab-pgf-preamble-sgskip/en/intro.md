# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Python's Matplotlib library to create plots and graphs. Matplotlib is a powerful library that allows you to create a wide range of visualizations, from simple line plots to complex heatmaps. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to use Matplotlib to create basic visualizations.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

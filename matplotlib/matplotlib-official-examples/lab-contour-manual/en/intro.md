# Introduction

This lab will guide you on how to display your own contour lines and polygons using ContourSet in Matplotlib. Contour lines for each level are a list/tuple of polygons. Filled contours between two levels are also a list/tuple of polygons. Points can be ordered clockwise or anticlockwise.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

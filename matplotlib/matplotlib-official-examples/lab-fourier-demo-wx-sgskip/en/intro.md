# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple GUI using Matplotlib in Python. Specifically, you will create a Fourier Demo that displays two waveforms in the frequency and time domains. You will be able to adjust the frequency and amplitude of the waveforms by clicking and dragging on the plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

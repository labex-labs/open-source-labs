# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides a wide variety of options for customizing plots and charts. In this lab, we will explore how to set the axis direction in Matplotlib using the `mpl_toolkits.axisartist` module.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a 3D wireframe plot using Python's Matplotlib library. A wireframe plot is a visual representation of a 3D surface where lines are drawn between each point on the surface. This type of plot is useful for visualizing complex 3D data and can be customized to create impressive visualizations.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides a wide range of functions to create different types of plots and charts. One of the features of Matplotlib is the ability to draw flat objects in 3D plots. This lab will guide you through the process of drawing flat objects in 3D plots using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

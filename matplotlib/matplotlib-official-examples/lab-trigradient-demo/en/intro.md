# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to create a gradient plot of an electrical dipole. You will learn how to create a triangulation, refine data, and compute the electrical field. Finally, you will plot the triangulation, the potential iso-contours, and the vector field.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

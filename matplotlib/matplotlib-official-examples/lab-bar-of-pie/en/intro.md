# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a "Bar of Pie" chart using Python's Matplotlib library. A Bar of Pie chart is a combination of a Pie chart and a stacked bar chart, where the first slice of the pie is exploded into a bar chart with a further breakdown of its characteristics. This chart is useful when you want to show the distribution of a whole data set, while also highlighting specific categories.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often useful to create multiple plots that share a common axis. This can be achieved using the `subplots` function in Matplotlib. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create adjacent subplots that share a common x-axis.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

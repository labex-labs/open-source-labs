# Introduction

Pie charts are popular data visualization tools used to represent data in a circular form. However, there are times when you might want to create a nested version of the pie chart, known as the donut chart. This tutorial will guide you through creating nested pie charts using Matplotlib, a popular data visualization library in Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In data visualization, it is crucial to have clear and readable plots. However, creating multiple subplots can make it difficult to avoid overlaps between axes objects and labels. In such cases, we can use a feature called _constrained layout_ in Matplotlib, which automatically resizes subplots to prevent overlaps between axes objects and labels.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

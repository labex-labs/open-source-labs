# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to generate an "unfolded" 3D plot using Matplotlib that shows each of the primary 3D view planes. We will also label the elevation, azimuth, and roll angles required for each view. This image can be printed out and folded into a box where each plane forms a side of the box.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

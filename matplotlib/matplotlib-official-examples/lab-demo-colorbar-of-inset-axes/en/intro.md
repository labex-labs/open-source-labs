# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to add a colorbar to inset axes using Matplotlib in Python. A colorbar is a visual representation of the mapping of a range of colors to a range of numerical values. An inset axis is a smaller axis that is placed within the larger axis of a plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

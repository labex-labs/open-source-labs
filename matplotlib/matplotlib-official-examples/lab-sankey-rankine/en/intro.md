# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a Sankey diagram using Python's Matplotlib library. Sankey diagrams are a type of flow diagram that are commonly used to visualize the flow of energy or materials through a system. They are especially useful for analyzing complex systems with multiple inputs and outputs.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Python's Matplotlib library to compute the mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) of 100 data sets and plot mu vs. sigma. We will also add interactivity to the plot so that when you click on one of the (mu, sigma) points, the raw data from the dataset that generated this point will be plotted.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

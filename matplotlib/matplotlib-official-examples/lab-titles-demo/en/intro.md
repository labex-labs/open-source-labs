# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to position titles on plots created with Matplotlib. Plot titles help viewers understand what information a visualization conveys. Matplotlib offers several options for positioning these titles - centered (the default), left-aligned, right-aligned, or with custom vertical positioning.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a basic plot with a centered title
- Position titles to the left or right of a plot
- Create a plot with the title at a custom position
- Use different methods to adjust title positioning

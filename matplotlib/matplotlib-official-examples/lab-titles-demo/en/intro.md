# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to position titles on plots created with Matplotlib. Plot titles help viewers understand what information a visualization conveys. Matplotlib offers several options for positioning these titles - centered (the default), left-aligned, right-aligned, or with custom vertical positioning.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a basic plot with a centered title
- Position titles to the left or right of a plot
- Create a plot with the title at a custom position
- Use different methods to adjust title positioning

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is complete, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook.

You may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. Due to limitations in Jupyter Notebook, the validation of operations cannot be automated.

If you encounter any issues during the lab, feel free to ask Labby for assistance. Please provide feedback after the session so we can promptly address any problems.

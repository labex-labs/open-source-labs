# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to control the positioning of plot titles in Matplotlib:

- **Basic Title Positioning**: You created simple plots with centered titles using the default positioning.

- **Horizontal Positioning**: You learned how to align titles to the left or right of a plot using the `loc` parameter.

- **Vertical Positioning**: You discovered how to adjust the vertical position of titles using the `y` parameter, placing them higher or lower relative to the plot.

- **Advanced Techniques with Subplots**: You explored how to position titles on individual subplots and how to add an overall figure title using `suptitle()`.

- **Global Settings with RCParams**: You learned how to set global defaults for title positioning using Matplotlib's runtime configuration parameters, allowing for consistent styling across multiple plots.

These skills will help you create more professional and visually appealing data visualizations, where the titles are positioned exactly where you want them to be. Title positioning is a small but important aspect of effective data visualization, helping to guide your audience's attention and improve the overall clarity of your plots.

For further exploration, consider experimenting with other title customization options like font properties, rotation, and colors to make your visualizations even more impactful.

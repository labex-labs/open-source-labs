# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib's `figimage` function to place images directly in a figure, without the need for Axes objects. This can be useful when you want to include images that are not part of your plot, such as a logo or watermark.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

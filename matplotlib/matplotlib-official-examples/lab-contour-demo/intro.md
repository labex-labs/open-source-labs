# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create contour plots using Python Matplotlib. Contour plots are useful for visualizing three-dimensional data in two dimensions. In this tutorial, we will be illustrating simple contour plotting, contours on an image with a colorbar for the contours, and labeled contours.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

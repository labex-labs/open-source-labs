# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a 3D box surface plot using Python and Matplotlib. We will define dimensions, create fake data, and plot contour surfaces. We will set limits of the plot, plot edges, set labels and zticks, set zoom and angle view, and add a colorbar.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

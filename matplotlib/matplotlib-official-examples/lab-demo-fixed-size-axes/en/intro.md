# Introduction

In data visualization, it's important to have consistent axes sizes in order to make meaningful comparisons between different plots. The Matplotlib library provides a way to create fixed size axes for figures that do not change size. In this lab, we will learn how to create fixed size axes using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Boxplots are a type of graph used to display the distribution of data based on five-number summary ("minimum", first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and "maximum"). They are commonly used in data analysis to identify and visualize outliers, as well as to compare the distribution of different groups of data. In this lab, you will learn how to create and customize boxplots in Python using the Matplotlib library.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

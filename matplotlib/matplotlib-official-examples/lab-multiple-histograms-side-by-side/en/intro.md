# Introduction

Histograms are a great way to visualize the distribution of a dataset, and Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python libraries for creating data visualizations. In this lab, we will use Matplotlib to create side-by-side histograms for multiple datasets.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for Python. It provides a variety of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, we will learn how to use `pcolormesh` and `pcolor` functions in Matplotlib to visualize 2D grids.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a line plot with dual axes using Matplotlib library in Python. We will plot two sets of data with different scales on the same graph. This is useful when we want to compare two related variables that have different units of measurement.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

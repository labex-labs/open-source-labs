# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often necessary to plot multiple variables with different units of measurement on the same graph. One common method to achieve this is by using multiple y-axes, where each y-axis corresponds to a different variable. In this lab, we will learn how to create a graph with multiple y-axes using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

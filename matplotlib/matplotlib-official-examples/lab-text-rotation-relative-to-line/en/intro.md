# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to rotate text objects in Matplotlib relative to a line or object on a plot rather than the screen coordinate system. This technique can be helpful when you want to rotate text in relation to something specific on the plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to create a contour plot of irregularly spaced data in Python using Matplotlib. The contour plot shows the 2D distribution of data values using iso-contours or contour lines. In this example, we will compare a contour plot of irregularly spaced data interpolated on a regular grid versus a tricontour plot for an unstructured triangular grid.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

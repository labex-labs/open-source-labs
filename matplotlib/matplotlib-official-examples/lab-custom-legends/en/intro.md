# Introduction

The Python Matplotlib library provides a flexible way to create and customize legends in a plot. Legends are an essential component of any plot, as they provide a clear and concise explanation of the data represented in the plot. This lab will guide you through the process of composing custom legends using Matplotlib objects.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a figure that contains both a 2D and a 3D plot using Matplotlib. The 2D plot will display a damped oscillation, while the 3D plot will display a sinusoidal wave.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

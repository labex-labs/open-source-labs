# Introduction

The Matplotlib TextPath is a module that enables the creation of a path that outlines the characters of a text. The resulting path can be used for several purposes, such as a clip path for an image. In this lab, you will learn how to use the TextPath module to create and customize text paths for images.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

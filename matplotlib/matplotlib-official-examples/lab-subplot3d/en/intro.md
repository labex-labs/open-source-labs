# Introduction

In data analysis, it's often necessary to create 3D plots to visualize data. In Matplotlib, we can create 3D plots as subplots to compare different 3D data. This lab will demonstrate how to create 3D plots as subplots using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

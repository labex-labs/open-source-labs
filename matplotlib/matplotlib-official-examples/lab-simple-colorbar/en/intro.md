# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to add a simple colorbar to a Matplotlib plot. A colorbar is a useful tool for visualizing the range of values represented by colors in a plot. We will use the `imshow` function to create a simple 2D plot and then add a colorbar to it.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

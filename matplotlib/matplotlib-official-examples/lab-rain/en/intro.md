# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a rain simulation using Python's Matplotlib library. The simulation will animate the scale and opacity of 50 scatter points to simulate raindrops falling on a surface.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

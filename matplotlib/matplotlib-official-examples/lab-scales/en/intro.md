# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. It allows users to create a wide variety of charts, plots, and graphs. One of the key features of Matplotlib is its ability to apply scale transformations to axes. This allows for greater flexibility in presenting data, especially when dealing with very large or very small numbers. In this lab, we will learn how to apply various scale transformations to axes using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

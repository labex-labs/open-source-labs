# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to downsample data using Matplotlib in Python. Downsampling is the process of reducing the sample rate or sample size of a signal. We will use a class that will downsample the data and recompute when zoomed.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

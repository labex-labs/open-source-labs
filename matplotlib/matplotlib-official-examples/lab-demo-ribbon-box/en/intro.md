# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library for Python. This tutorial will guide you through creating a ribbon box chart, a unique way to visualize data. A ribbon box chart is a stacked bar chart where each bar is "ribbon-like" and has a gradient color scheme.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

When visualizing financial data, it is essential to format the axes appropriately with currency symbols. Matplotlib is a powerful Python library for creating visualizations, but by default, it does not display currency symbols on the axes.

In this lab, we will learn how to customize a Matplotlib plot to display dollar signs on the y-axis labels. This skill is valuable when working with financial data, sales figures, budgets, or any other datasets that require currency formatting.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is complete, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

You may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you encounter any issues during the lab, feel free to ask Labby. Please provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve any problems for you.

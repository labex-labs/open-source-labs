# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create financial plots with proper currency formatting using Matplotlib. We covered several important concepts:

1. Generating and working with sample financial data
2. Creating basic plots with Matplotlib
3. Formatting y-axis labels with dollar signs using the `StrMethodFormatter` class
4. Enhancing plots with statistics, annotations, and improved styling
5. Creating a reusable function for generating consistent currency-formatted plots

These skills are essential for anyone working with financial data visualization, as they allow you to create professional and informative charts that clearly communicate monetary values.

The techniques you learned can be applied to various financial datasets such as:

- Sales and revenue reports
- Budget analysis
- Investment performance tracking
- Cost analysis
- Expense tracking

By properly formatting your axes with currency symbols, you make your visualizations more intuitive and professional, enhancing the effectiveness of your data communication.

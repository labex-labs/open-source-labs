# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. The contour plot represents a 3D surface using contours or level curves. We will use the `contour()` function to create these level curves, and the `extend3d=True` option to extend the curves vertically into 'ribbons'.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Matplotlib is a library used for data visualization in Python. It provides a wide range of tools for creating various types of plots, graphs, and charts. One of the useful features of Matplotlib is the ability to customize the coordinate formatter. In this lab, we will go through the steps of modifying the coordinate formatter in Matplotlib to report the image "z" value of the nearest pixel given x and y.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

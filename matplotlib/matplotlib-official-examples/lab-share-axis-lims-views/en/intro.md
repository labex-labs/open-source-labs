# Introduction

When creating multiple plots that share a common axis, you may want to ensure that when you zoom in or out on one plot, the other plots update as well. In this lab, we will explore how to use the `sharex` and `sharey` attributes in Matplotlib to create plots that share an axis.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

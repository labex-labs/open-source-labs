# Introduction

Data visualization often presents challenges when dealing with outliers. These extreme values can compress the majority of your data points, making it difficult to observe important patterns or details. A broken axis plot provides an elegant solution by "breaking" the axis to show different ranges of values, allowing you to focus on both the main data distribution and the outliers simultaneously.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a broken axis plot using Matplotlib in Python. This technique is particularly useful when visualizing datasets with significant value disparities, enabling clearer representation of both normal data and extreme values.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is complete, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

You may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. Due to limitations in Jupyter Notebook, the validation of operations cannot be automated.

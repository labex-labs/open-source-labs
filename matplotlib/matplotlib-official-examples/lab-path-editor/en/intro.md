# Introduction

This lab will guide you through an example of a cross-GUI application using Matplotlib event handling to interact with and modify objects on the canvas. You will learn how to edit a path on a plot, by dragging markers with the mouse, and toggling their visibility.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

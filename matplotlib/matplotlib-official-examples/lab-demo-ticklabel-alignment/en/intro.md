# Introduction

In data visualization, tick labels play an important role in conveying information to viewers. Sometimes, we may need to adjust the alignment of tick labels to make them more readable or to avoid overlapping. In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to adjust the alignment of tick labels.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab aims to introduce you to the concept of picking in Matplotlib. The ability to pick artists is a powerful tool that can be used to build interactive visualizations that respond to user actions. We will cover simple picking, picking with custom hit test functions, picking on a scatter plot, and picking images.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

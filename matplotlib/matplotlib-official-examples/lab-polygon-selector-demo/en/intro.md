# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use the Polygon Selector tool in Matplotlib to select indices from a collection. The Polygon Selector tool allows the user to select points on a graph by drawing a polygon around them. The selected points are then highlighted while the unselected points are faded out. The indices of the selected points are saved in an array, which can then be used for further analysis.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

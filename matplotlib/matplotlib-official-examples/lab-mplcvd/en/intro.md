# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It has various built-in features, including the ability to simulate color vision deficiencies. This lab will guide you through the steps of using Matplotlib to simulate color vision deficiencies.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `bar_label` helper function in Matplotlib to create labeled bar charts. We will cover various scenarios such as labeling horizontal and vertical bar charts, using different label formats, and customizing label appearance.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

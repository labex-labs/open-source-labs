# Introduction

In a Matplotlib plot, ticks are used to mark the position of data points on the axis. Major ticks are the larger ticks that denote the values of the data points and minor ticks are the smaller ticks that are placed between the major ticks. This tutorial shows how to use major and minor ticks in Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create wind barb plots using Python Matplotlib. Wind barbs are a graphical representation of wind speed and direction using a combination of flags, lines, and dots. The length of the line represents the wind speed, while the orientation of the flags and dots represent the wind direction.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often necessary to show the degree of uncertainty in the data being plotted. Error bars are a convenient way to represent this uncertainty. In this lab, we will learn how to selectively draw lower and/or upper limit symbols on error bars using the parameters `uplims` and `lolims` in Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

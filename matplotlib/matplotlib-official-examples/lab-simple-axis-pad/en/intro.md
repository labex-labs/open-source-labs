# Introduction

This lab will teach you how to use the `add_floating_axis` function in Matplotlib to add floating axes to a plot, which can be used to display additional information about the plot. Specifically, you will learn how to adjust the padding of tick labels and axis labels, as well as how to adjust the position of ticks on the floating axes.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

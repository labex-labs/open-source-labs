# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to set the default y-axis tick labels on the right side of the plot using Matplotlib. By default, the y-axis tick labels are placed on the left side of the plot. However, sometimes it might be more suitable to have them on the right side instead.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

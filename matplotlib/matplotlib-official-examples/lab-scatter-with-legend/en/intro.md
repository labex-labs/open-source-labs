# Introduction

Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two variables. A scatter plot with a legend is useful when there are multiple groups in the data, and we want to distinguish between them in the plot. In this lab, we will learn how to create scatter plots with legends in Python using Matplotlib library.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

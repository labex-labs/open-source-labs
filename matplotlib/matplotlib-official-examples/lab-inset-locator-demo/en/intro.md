# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python. The `.inset_locator` feature allows for easy placement of insets in the corners of the axes. In this lab, we will explore how to use the `.inset_locator` feature to create insets in Matplotlib plots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

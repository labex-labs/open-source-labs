# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used to create visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and more. In this lab, we will learn how to use text commands to add text to our plots. We will explore different ways to add text and annotations to our plots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

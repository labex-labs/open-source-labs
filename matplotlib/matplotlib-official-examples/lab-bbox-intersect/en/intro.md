# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to change the colors of lines intersecting a rectangle using the `.intersects_bbox` function from Matplotlib. We will create a rectangle and generate random lines that intersect it. Then, we will change the color of the intersecting lines to red and the remaining lines to blue.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

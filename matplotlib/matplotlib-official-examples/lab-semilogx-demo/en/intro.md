# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through how to assign a log scale for the x-axis using `matplotlib.axes.Axes.semilogx` in Python Matplotlib. A logarithmic scale is useful when the data you want to plot spans several orders of magnitude. In this tutorial, we will use an example of plotting exponential decay as a function of time.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

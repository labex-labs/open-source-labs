# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through creating a visualization using Matplotlib collection. The tutorial will show you how to use LineCollection, PolyCollection, and RegularPolyCollection. The tutorial will also show you how to use the offsets and offset_transform keyword arguments of the LineCollection and PolyCollection to set the positions of the spirals. The tutorial will also show you how to use the RegularPolyCollection to make regular polygons.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

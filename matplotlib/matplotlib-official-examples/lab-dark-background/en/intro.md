# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, we will learn how to use the 'dark_background' style sheet in Matplotlib to create plots with a dark background. The dark background style sheet is particularly useful for displaying visualizations that are easy on the eyes in low-light environments.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a 3D voxel plot using the Matplotlib library in Python. Voxel plots are useful for visualizing 3D data in a way that is both clear and aesthetically pleasing. In this lab, we will be using the `Axes3D.voxels` function to create a voxel plot of two cubes and a link between them.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

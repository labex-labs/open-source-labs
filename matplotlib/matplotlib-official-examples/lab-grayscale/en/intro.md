# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python used to create a variety of charts, graphs, and plots. It provides a wide range of customization options to create attractive visualizations. One of these options is style sheets. A style sheet is a collection of settings that define the look of a plot. In this lab, we will explore the "grayscale" style sheet, which changes all colors to grayscale.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

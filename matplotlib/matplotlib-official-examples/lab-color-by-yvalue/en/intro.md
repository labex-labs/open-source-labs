# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python. It is a powerful tool for creating a wide range of graphs and charts. One of the features of Matplotlib is the ability to plot lines with different colors based on the y-value. This lab will demonstrate how to use masked arrays to plot a line with different colors by y-value.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

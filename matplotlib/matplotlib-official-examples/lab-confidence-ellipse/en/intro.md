# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to plot confidence ellipses of a two-dimensional dataset using Python Matplotlib. A confidence ellipse is a graphical representation of the covariance of a dataset, showing the uncertainty of the estimated mean and standard deviation. The ellipses are plotted using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

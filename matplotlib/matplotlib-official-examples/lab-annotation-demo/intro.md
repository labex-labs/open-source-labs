# Introduction

This lab will guide you through annotating plots in Matplotlib. You will learn how to highlight specific points of interest and use various visual tools to call attention to these points. Annotation and text tools are essential for conveying information and making plots more visually appealing.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

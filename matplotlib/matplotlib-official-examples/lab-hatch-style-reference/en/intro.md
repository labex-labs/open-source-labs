# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of adding hatches to most polygons in Matplotlib, including Axes.bar, Axes.fill_between, Axes.contourf, and children of patches.Polygon. You will learn how to create different hatching patterns, repeat them to increase density, and combine them to create additional patterns.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through how to create a simple animation using `matplotlib.pyplot`. Animations can be useful for visualizing data that changes over time. In this tutorial, we will generate a random set of data and display it as an animation.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

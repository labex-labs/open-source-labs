# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating a wide range of visualizations, from simple line plots to complex heatmaps. In this lab, we will go through the basics of Matplotlib and create a simple line plot using the "fivethirtyeight" style sheet.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

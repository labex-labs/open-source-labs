# Introduction

Boxplot is a graphical representation of a group of data through their quartiles. It is used to show the distribution of data based on their five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create and customize a boxplot using Matplotlib library in Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

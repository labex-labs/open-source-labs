# Introduction

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Matplotlib's ImageGrid to create a grid of images with shared x and y axes. The tutorial will cover two demos:

- Demo 1 shows how to add a colorbar at each axis.
- Demo 2 shows how to add a shared colorbar.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

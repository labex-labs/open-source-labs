# Introduction

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. One of the features of Matplotlib is the ability to create customized box styles.

In this lab, you will learn how to implement custom box styles in Matplotlib. You will learn how to create a custom box style as a function and as a class. You will also learn how to register a custom box style with Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

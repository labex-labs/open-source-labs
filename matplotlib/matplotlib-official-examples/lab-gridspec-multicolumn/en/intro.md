# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for the Python programming language. It provides a wide range of tools for creating different types of plots and charts. The GridSpec module in Matplotlib allows us to create flexible and complex layouts of subplots. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use GridSpec to create multi-column/row subplot layouts.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

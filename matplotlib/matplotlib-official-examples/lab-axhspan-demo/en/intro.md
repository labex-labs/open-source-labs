# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create lines and rectangles that span the axes in either the horizontal or vertical direction, and lines than span the axes with an arbitrary orientation using Matplotlib library in Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

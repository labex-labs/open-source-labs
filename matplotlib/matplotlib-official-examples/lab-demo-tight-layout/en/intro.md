# Introduction

This lab is designed to provide a step-by-step guide for using Matplotlib, a Python library for creating visualizations. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization tool in the scientific and engineering communities. This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating visualizations using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

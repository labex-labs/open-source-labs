# Introduction

This step-by-step lab will guide you through using Python's Matplotlib library to create visualizations. Matplotlib is a data visualization library that allows users to create a wide range of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, and histograms. In this lab, we will create a simple scatter plot using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

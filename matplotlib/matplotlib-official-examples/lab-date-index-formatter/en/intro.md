# Introduction

When plotting daily data such as financial time series, one often wants to leave out days on which there is no data, such as weekends. This allows the data to be plotted at regular intervals without extra spaces for the days with no data. In this lab, we will learn how to use an 'index formatter' to achieve the desired plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

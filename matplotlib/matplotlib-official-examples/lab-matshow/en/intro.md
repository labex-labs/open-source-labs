# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It can be used to create a variety of different types of plots and charts. One of the functions provided by Matplotlib is `matshow()`, which can be used to visualize a 2D matrix or array as a color-coded image. In this lab, we will go through the steps to use `matshow()` to visualize a 2D array.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

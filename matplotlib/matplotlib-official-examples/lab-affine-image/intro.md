# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Matplotlib to perform affine transformation of an image. Affine transformations change the shape and orientation of an image. This lab shows how to use the `transforms.Affine2D` function to manipulate the shape and orientation of an image.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

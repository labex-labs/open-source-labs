# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create and customize legends in Matplotlib. Legends are used to explain the meaning of the elements in a chart, including lines, bars, and markers. We will demonstrate how to create legends for specific lines, complex labels, and more complex plots. Finally, we will show how to write custom classes to stylize legends.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

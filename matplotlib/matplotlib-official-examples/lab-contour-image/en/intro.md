# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a contour image using Python's Matplotlib library. The contour image is a visualization technique that represents a three-dimensional surface using a two-dimensional plot. The contour image consists of contour lines, which are lines that connect points of equal value in the surface, and filled contours, which are regions between the contour lines.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

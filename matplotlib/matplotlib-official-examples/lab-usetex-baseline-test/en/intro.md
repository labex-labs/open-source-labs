# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the text baselines computed for mathtext and usetex using Matplotlib library. We will create a plot that contains two subplots, one with mathtext and the other with usetex. Each subplot will display four test strings with different styles and positions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

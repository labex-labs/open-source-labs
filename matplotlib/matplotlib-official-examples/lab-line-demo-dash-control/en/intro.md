# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to customize the dashed line styles in Matplotlib. We will cover how to modify the dash sequence using `.Line2D.set_dashes()`, configure the dash style using a `property_cycle`, and set other attributes of the dash using relevant methods like `~.Line2D.set_dash_capstyle()`, `~.Line2D.set_dash_joinstyle()`, and `~.Line2D.set_gapcolor()`.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Error bars are used in graphs and charts to show the potential error or uncertainty in a measurement or data point. Python Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library that provides different types of error bar plots. In this lab, we will learn how to create error bar plots with upper and lower limits using Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

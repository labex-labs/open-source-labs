# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the `JoinStyle` module of Matplotlib in Python. `JoinStyle` controls how Matplotlib draws the corners where two different line segments meet. This lab is designed for users who are new to Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

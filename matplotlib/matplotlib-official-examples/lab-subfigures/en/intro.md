# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating visualizations, such as graphs, charts, and figures. In this lab, you will learn how to create subfigures in Matplotlib. Subfigures are figures that contain two or more plots within the same figure. Subfigures can help you to compare different data sets or to show different views of the same data. They are useful when you want to display multiple plots together.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

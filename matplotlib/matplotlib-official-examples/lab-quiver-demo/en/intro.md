# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that allows users to create a wide range of 2D and 3D plots. One of the many useful features of Matplotlib is the ability to create quiver plots, which display vector fields.

This lab will walk through some advanced options for the `quiver()` and `quiverkey()` functions in Matplotlib. These functions allow for customization of the arrows in a quiver plot, including arrow scale, pivot point, and arrow frequency.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It allows you to create a variety of plots, such as scatter plots, histograms, bar graphs, and more. The style sheets reference script demonstrates the different available style sheets on a common set of example plots. In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib style sheets to customize the appearance of your plots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

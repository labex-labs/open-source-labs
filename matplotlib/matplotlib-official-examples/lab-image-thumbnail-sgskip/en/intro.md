# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of generating thumbnails from existing images using Matplotlib library in Python. Thumbnails are smaller versions of images that can be used to display a preview of the larger image. Matplotlib depends on Pillow library for reading images and supports all formats supported by Pillow.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

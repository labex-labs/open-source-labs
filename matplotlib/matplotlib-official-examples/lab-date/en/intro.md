# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create date plots using Matplotlib in Python. We will use the `matplotlib.dates` module to convert datetime objects to Matplotlib's internal representation. We will also learn how to format the tick labels on the x-axis to display dates in a readable format.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

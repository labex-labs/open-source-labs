# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create color maps using Matplotlib. Color maps are useful when visualizing data, as they provide a way to represent numerical data through colors. Matplotlib provides a variety of built-in color maps, as well as the ability to create custom color maps.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

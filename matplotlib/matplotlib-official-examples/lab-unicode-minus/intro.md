# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to control the tick labels in a Matplotlib plot using Unicode minus and ASCII hyphen. By default, tick labels at negative values are rendered using a Unicode minus rather than an ASCII hyphen. However, this can be controlled by setting `axes.unicode_minus`. We will use a sample code snippet to showcase the difference between the two glyphs in a magnified font.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

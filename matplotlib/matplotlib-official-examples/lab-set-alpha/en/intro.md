# Introduction

This lab explores how to set color transparency (alpha values) using the Python Matplotlib library. In data visualization, transparency is a powerful tool that can reveal patterns in overlapping elements or highlight certain data points.

Alpha values in Matplotlib range from 0 to 1:

- 0 means completely transparent (invisible)
- 1 means completely opaque (solid)
- Values between 0 and 1 create varying levels of transparency

We will explore two main approaches to set alpha values in Matplotlib:

1. Using the `alpha` keyword argument
2. Using the `(matplotlib_color, alpha)` color format

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create visualizations with customized transparency settings that enhance your data presentation.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is complete, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

You may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. Due to limitations in Jupyter Notebook, the validation of operations cannot be automated.

If you encounter any issues during the lab, feel free to ask Labby for assistance. We appreciate your feedback after the session to help us improve the lab experience.

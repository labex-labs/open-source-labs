# Introduction

This lab explores how to set color transparency (alpha values) using the Python Matplotlib library. In data visualization, transparency is a powerful tool that can reveal patterns in overlapping elements or highlight certain data points.

Alpha values in Matplotlib range from 0 to 1:

- 0 means completely transparent (invisible)
- 1 means completely opaque (solid)
- Values between 0 and 1 create varying levels of transparency

We will explore two main approaches to set alpha values in Matplotlib:

1. Using the `alpha` keyword argument
2. Using the `(matplotlib_color, alpha)` color format

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create visualizations with customized transparency settings that enhance your data presentation.

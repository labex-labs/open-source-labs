# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use `GridSpec` to generate subplots, control the relative sizes of subplots with _width_ratios_ and _height_ratios_, and the spacing around and between subplots using subplot params (_left_, _right_, _bottom_, _top_, _wspace_, and _hspace_).

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In signal processing, Cross Spectral Density (CSD) is a measure of the correlation between two signals in the frequency domain. It is used to determine how much two signals are related to each other in terms of their frequency content. In this lab, you will learn how to compute the CSD of two signals using Python's Matplotlib library.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

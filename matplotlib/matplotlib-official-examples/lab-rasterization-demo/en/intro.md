# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about rasterization for vector graphics. Rasterization is a process of converting vector graphics into a raster image (pixels). It can speed up rendering and produce smaller files for large data sets, but comes at the cost of a fixed resolution. We will be using Python Matplotlib library to illustrate the concept of rasterization.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a SkewT-logP diagram using Matplotlib library in Python. A SkewT-logP diagram is commonly used in meteorology for displaying vertical profiles of temperature. It is a complex plot as it involves non-orthogonal X and Y axes. We will use the Matplotlib's transforms and custom projection API to create this plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create anchored direction arrows in Matplotlib. Anchored direction arrows are arrows that point in a specific direction and are anchored to a plot. These arrows are useful for indicating specific directions or orientations in a plot. We will learn how to create simple arrows as well as high contrast and rotated arrows.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

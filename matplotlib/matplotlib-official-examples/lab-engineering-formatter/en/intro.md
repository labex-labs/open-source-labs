# Introduction

In data visualization, it is essential to label the ticks on axes accurately. The `EngFormatter` in Matplotlib is a class that enables one to label the ticks on an axis using engineering notation. Engineering notation is a mathematical representation of numbers that uses powers of ten with a multiple of three. It is a concise way to express large or small numbers that are difficult to read or write in standard notation. In this lab, we will learn how to label ticks on an axis using engineering notation.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple timeline using Matplotlib release dates. A timeline is a graphical representation of a sequence of events in chronological order. Timelines can be created with a collection of dates and text. In this example, we will show how to create a simple timeline using the dates for recent releases of Matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

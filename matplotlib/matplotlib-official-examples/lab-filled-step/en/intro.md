# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create hatch-filled histograms using Matplotlib. A histogram is a graphical representation of data that uses bars to show the frequency of numerical data. A hatch-filled histogram is a histogram in which the bars are filled with a pattern of lines, dots, or other symbols.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

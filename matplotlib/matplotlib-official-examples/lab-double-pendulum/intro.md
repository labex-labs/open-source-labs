# Introduction

The double pendulum is a classic problem in physics and mathematics. It involves two pendulums attached to each other, and the motion of the second pendulum is affected by the motion of the first pendulum. In this lab, we will use Python and Matplotlib to simulate the motion of a double pendulum.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

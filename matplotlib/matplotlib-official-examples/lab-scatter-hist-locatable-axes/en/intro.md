# Introduction

In data visualization, scatter plots are used to show the relationship between two variables. Additionally, histograms are useful for showing the distribution of a single variable. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a scatter plot with histograms using Python's Matplotlib library.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

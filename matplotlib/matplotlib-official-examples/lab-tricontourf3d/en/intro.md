# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a triangular 3D filled contour plot using the Matplotlib library in Python. The plot will be created using unstructured triangular grids and customized triangulation. You will be able to control the view angle and color map of the plot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to create visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is a powerful library for data visualization and is commonly used to create plots, charts, and graphs. We will explore the different types of plots available in Matplotlib and learn how to customize them to create professional-looking visualizations.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

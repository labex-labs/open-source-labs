# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you on how to create a 3D scatterplot using Python's Matplotlib library. The scatterplot is a graphical representation of the relationship between three variables. It is a useful tool for identifying patterns and trends in complex data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

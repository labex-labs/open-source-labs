# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to move the x-axis tick labels to the top of the plot using Python's Matplotlib library. By default, Matplotlib places x-axis labels at the bottom of the plot. However, sometimes we might want to place them at the top for better visualization, especially when dealing with crowded plots or long labels that might overlap with other elements.

This technique is particularly useful in data visualization scenarios where you need to optimize the use of space and improve readability of your plots. We will create a simple plot and learn how to manipulate the position of the tick labels step by step.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is complete, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

You may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. Due to limitations in Jupyter Notebook, the validation of operations cannot be automated.

If you encounter any issues during this tutorial, feel free to ask Labby. Please provide feedback after the session so we can promptly address any problems.

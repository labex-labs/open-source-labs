# Customizing the Plot Further

Now that we have moved the x-axis tick labels to the top, let's further customize our plot to make it more visually appealing and informative.

## Advanced Plot Customization Techniques

Matplotlib offers numerous options for customizing plots. Let's explore some of these options:

```python
# Create a new figure and a set of axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Generate some data with more points for a smoother curve
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = np.cos(x)

# Plot multiple datasets
ax.plot(x, y1, linewidth=2, color='blue', label='sin(x)')
ax.plot(x, y2, linewidth=2, color='red', label='cos(x)')

# Fill the area between curves
ax.fill_between(x, y1, y2, where=(y1 > y2), alpha=0.3, color='green', interpolate=True)
ax.fill_between(x, y1, y2, where=(y1 <= y2), alpha=0.3, color='purple', interpolate=True)

# Move the x-axis tick labels to the top
ax.tick_params(
    axis='x',
    top=True,
    labeltop=True,
    bottom=False,
    labelbottom=False
)

# Customize tick labels
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(0, 2*np.pi + 0.1, np.pi/2))
ax.set_xticklabels(['0', 'π/2', 'π', '3π/2', '2π'])

# Add title and labels with custom styles
ax.set_title('Sine and Cosine Functions with Customized X-Axis Labels at the Top',
             fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax.set_xlabel('Angle (radians)', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Function Value', fontsize=12)

# Add a grid and customize its appearance
ax.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.7, which='both')

# Customize the axis limits
ax.set_ylim(-1.2, 1.2)

# Add a legend with custom location and style
ax.legend(loc='upper right', fontsize=12, framealpha=0.8)

# Add annotations to highlight important points
ax.annotate('Maximum', xy=(np.pi/2, 1), xytext=(np.pi/2, 1.1),
            arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05, width=1.5),
            fontsize=10, ha='center')

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()  # Adjust spacing for better appearance
plt.show()

print("We have created a fully customized plot with x-axis tick labels at the top!")
```

When you run this code, you will see a much more elaborate and professional-looking plot with:

- Two curves (sine and cosine)
- Colored regions between the curves
- Custom tick labels (using π notation)
- Annotations pointing to key features
- Better spacing and styling

Notice how we've kept the x-axis tick labels at the top using the `tick_params()` method but enhanced the plot with additional customizations.

## Understanding the Customizations

Let's break down some of the key customizations we added:

1. `fill_between()`: Creates colored regions between the sine and cosine curves
2. `set_xticks()` and `set_xticklabels()`: Customize the tick positions and labels
3. `tight_layout()`: Automatically adjusts plot spacing for better appearance
4. `annotate()`: Adds text with an arrow pointing to a specific point
5. Customized fonts, colors, and styles for various elements

These customizations demonstrate how you can create visually appealing and informative plots while keeping the x-axis tick labels at the top.

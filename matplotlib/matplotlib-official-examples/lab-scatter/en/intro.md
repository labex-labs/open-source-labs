# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a simple scatter plot using Python's Matplotlib library. A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays values for two variables as a collection of points. Each point represents the values of the two variables, and the position of the point represents the values of the two variables. Scatter plots are useful for identifying relationships between variables and for identifying outliers.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

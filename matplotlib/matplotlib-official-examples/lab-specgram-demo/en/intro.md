# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a spectrogram plot using Matplotlib. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. Spectrograms are commonly used to analyze the frequency content of a signal over time, such as in speech recognition, music analysis, and audio signal processing. We will use Python and Matplotlib to create a spectrogram plot of a signal.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to plot the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of a sample and the theoretical CDF using Matplotlib. ECDFs are also known as "non-exceedance" curves in engineering, where the y-value for a given x-value gives the probability that an observation from the sample is below that x-value. Conversely, the empirical _complementary_ cumulative distribution function (the ECCDF, or "exceedance" curve) shows the probability y that an observation from the sample is above a value x.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

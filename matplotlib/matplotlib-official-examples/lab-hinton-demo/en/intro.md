# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Hinton diagrams for visualizing weight matrices. Hinton diagrams are very useful when you want to visualize a 2D array, such as a weight matrix. Positive and negative values are represented by white and black squares, respectively, and the size of each square represents the magnitude of each value.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

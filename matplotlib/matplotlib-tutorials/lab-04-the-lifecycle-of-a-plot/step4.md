# Customize the plot style

We can change the style of our plot to make it more visually appealing. Follow these steps:

1. Print the list of available styles using `print(plt.style.available)`.

```python
print(plt.style.available)
```

2. Choose a style and apply it using `plt.style.use(style_name)`.

```python
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

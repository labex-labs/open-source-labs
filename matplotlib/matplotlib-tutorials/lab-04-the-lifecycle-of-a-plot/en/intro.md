# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the lifecycle of a plot using Matplotlib. We will start with raw data and end by saving a customized visualization. We will learn how to create a plot, control its style, customize its appearance, combine multiple visualizations, and save the plot to disk.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

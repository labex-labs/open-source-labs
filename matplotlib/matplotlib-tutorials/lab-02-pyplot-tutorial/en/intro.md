# Introduction

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to using the `pyplot` interface in Matplotlib. The `pyplot` module is a collection of functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB, allowing you to easily create and customize plots. This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Matplotlib and its concepts.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

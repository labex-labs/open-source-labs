# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to plot and manipulate images using the Matplotlib library in Python. You will learn how to import image data into NumPy arrays, plot numpy arrays as images, apply pseudocolor schemes, add color scale references, examine specific data ranges, and explore different interpolation schemes.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

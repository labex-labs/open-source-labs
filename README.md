# LabEx Open-Source Labs

This repository contains the source code for the LabEx Open-Source Labs.

## License

The labs in this repository are sourced from the open-source community and have been revised to be compatible with LabEx under the terms of the agreement.

The `index.json` file displays the source and open-source license for each lab, which remains unchanged even after adaptation.

Open source does not always mean that it is free. Some labs require Pro users to access them due to the higher environmental costs involved, but you can still freely access the original content.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the original creators. ❤️

## Update

LabEx has transitioned away from open-source labs entirely. Future versions will exclusively feature official, self-developed labs.

We will no longer maintain these open source labs. Thanks to the original author for their selfless contribution. ❤️

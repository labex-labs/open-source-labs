# Priority Queue

A priority queue is a data structure that allows for efficient access to the minimum (or maximum) element in a collection. It is commonly used in algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Huffman coding. In this challenge, we will implement a priority queue backed by an array.

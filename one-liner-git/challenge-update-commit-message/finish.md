# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to change the last commit's message without changing its contents using the `git commit --amend -m <message>` command. This can be useful when you need to correct a mistake in the commit message or provide more context about the changes you made. Remember to use this command with caution, as it can modify the commit history and potentially cause issues for other developers working on the same repository.

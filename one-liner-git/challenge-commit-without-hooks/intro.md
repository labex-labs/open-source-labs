# Commit without Running Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically before or after certain Git commands, such as `commit` or `push`. They are useful for enforcing code quality standards, running tests, or performing other automated tasks. However, sometimes you may need to skip these hooks and commit your changes without them.

### Sleep Command:

When you want to pause the execution of any command for specific period of time then you can use **sleep** command. You can set the delay amount by **seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) and days (d).** Create a file named **‘sleep_example.sh’** and add the following script. This script will wait for 5 seconds after running.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Wait for 5 seconds"  
sleep 5  
echo "Completed"

Run the file with bash command.

$ bash sleep_example.sh

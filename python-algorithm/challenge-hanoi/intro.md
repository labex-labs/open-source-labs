# Hanoi

The Towers of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

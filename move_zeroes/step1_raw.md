Problem: Move all zeroes in a list to the end.

## Requirements

- Is the input an array of ints?
  - Yes
- Is the output a new array of ints?
  - No, do this in-place
- Do we need to maintain ordering of non-zero values?
  - Yes
- Can we assume the inputs are valid?
  - No
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

<pre>
* None -> TypeError
* [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
* [1, 0] -> [1, 0]
* [0, 1] -> [1, 0]
* [0] -> [0]
* [1] -> [1]
* [1, 1] -> [1, 1]

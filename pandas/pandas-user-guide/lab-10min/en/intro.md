# Introduction

In this lab, we will introduce you to the basics of pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. We will guide you through various tasks such as importing pandas, creating and viewing data, data selection, operations and much more.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

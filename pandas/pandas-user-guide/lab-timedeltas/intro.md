# Introduction

This lab guides you through the process of working with time deltas in Python using the pandas library. A time delta represents a duration or difference in time. We will explore different ways to construct, manipulate, and operate on time deltas.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

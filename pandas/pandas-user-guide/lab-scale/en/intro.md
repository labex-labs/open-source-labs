# Introduction

This lab focuses on how to scale data analysis to larger datasets using pandas. It covers methods like loading less data, using efficient data types, chunking, and leveraging other libraries like Dask. It is important to note that pandas is more suited for in-memory analytics and might not be the best tool for very large datasets.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

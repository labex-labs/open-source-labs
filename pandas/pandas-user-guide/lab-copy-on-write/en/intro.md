# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on understanding and implementing the concept of Copy-On-Write (CoW) in Python Pandas. CoW is an optimization strategy that enhances performance and memory usage by delaying copies as long as possible. It also helps in avoiding accidental modifications of more than one object.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Welcome to the Pandas Basics Lab! In this lab, we will explore some fundamental aspects of the Pandas library: DataFrame memory usage, handling if/truth statements, using User Defined Function (UDF) methods, dealing with NA values, differences with NumPy, and thread-safety considerations.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

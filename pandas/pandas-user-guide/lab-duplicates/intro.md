# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to handle duplicate labels in pandas. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. Often, we encounter data with duplicate row or column labels, and it's crucial to understand how to detect and handle these duplicates.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

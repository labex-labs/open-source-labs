# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of utilizing PyArrow in pandas to extend functionality and improve the performance of various APIs. PyArrow enhances pandas with more extensive data types, missing data support for all data types, IO reader integration, and interoperability with other data frame libraries.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

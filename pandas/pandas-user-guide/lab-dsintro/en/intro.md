# Introduction

Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. Its fundamental data structures, Series and DataFrame, allow you to store and manipulate structured data. This lab will provide a step-by-step guide on how to work with these data structures, from creation to manipulation and alignment.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

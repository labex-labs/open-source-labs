# Introduction

In data analysis, it is common to encounter datasets that are not arranged in the way we want. Reshaping data refers to the process of changing how data is organized into rows and columns. In this lab, we will explore some of the key methods in Pandas for reshaping data including Pivot, Stack, Unstack, Melt, Cross tabulations, Tiling, Factorizing, and Exploding.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

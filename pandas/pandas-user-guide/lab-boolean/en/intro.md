# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Nullable Boolean data type, provided by the Pandas library in Python. We will learn how to use this feature in indexing and logical operations, and how it differs from traditional boolean operations due to the presence of 'NA' values.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

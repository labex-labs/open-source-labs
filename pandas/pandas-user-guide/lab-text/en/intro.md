# Introduction

This lab introduces how to handle text data in pandas. We will learn how to store text data, use string methods for data preprocessing and transformation, and extract substrings using regular expressions. We will also learn how to create dummy variables for machine learning algorithms.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

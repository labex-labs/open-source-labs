# Introduction

This Python Pandas Lab aims to introduce you to the fundamental operations of the pandas library, which is a powerful data manipulation tool in Python. Throughout this lab, you will work with numerous examples and code snippets to solidify your understanding of pandas.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab focuses on understanding how to configure and customize global behavior related to Pandas DataFrame display, data behavior, and more. We will explore how to get/set options, reset options to their default values, and describe options. We will also learn how to execute a code block with a set of options that revert to prior settings after execution.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

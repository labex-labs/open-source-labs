# Introduction

In this lab, we will work with air quality data to explore how to combine multiple tables using Python's Pandas library. We will be using the `concat` and `merge` functions to perform these operations. This lab will help you understand how to concatenate and merge data frames effectively.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create plots using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. We will use real air quality data for practical illustrations. By the end of this lab, you should be able to use Pandas to create line plots, scatter plots, box plots, and customize your plots.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

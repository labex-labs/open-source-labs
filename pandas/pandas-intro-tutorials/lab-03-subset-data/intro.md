# Introduction

In this lab, we are going to learn how to select specific data from a DataFrame using Pandas, a popular data analysis and manipulation library in Python. We will use the Titanic dataset for this tutorial.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

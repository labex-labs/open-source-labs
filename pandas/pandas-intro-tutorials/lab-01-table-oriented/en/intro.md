# Introduction

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation tool developed by Python. It's often used in data analysis and cleaning because it's flexible and easy to use. In this lab, we will learn how to use Pandas to perform basic operations like loading data, creating data frames, accessing data, and performing simple statistics.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

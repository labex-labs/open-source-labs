# Writing our first test

## We identify a bug

Fortunately, there's a little bug in the `polls` application for us to fix right away: the `Question.was_published_recently()` method returns `True` if the `Question` was published within the last day (which is correct) but also if the `Question`â€™s `pub_date` field is in the future (which certainly isn't).

Confirm the bug by using the `shell` to check the method on a question whose date lies in the future:

```bash
cd ~/project/mysite
python manage.py shell
```

```python
>>> import datetime
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> from polls.models import Question
>>> # create a Question instance with pub_date 30 days in the future
>>> future_question = Question(pub_date=timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30))
>>> # was it published recently?
>>> future_question.was_published_recently()
True
```

Since things in the future are not 'recent', this is clearly wrong.

## Create a test to expose the bug

What we've just done in the `shell` to test for the problem is exactly what we can do in an automated test, so let's turn that into an automated test.

A conventional place for an application's tests is in the application's `tests.py` file; the testing system will automatically find tests in any file whose name begins with `test`.

Put the following in the `tests.py` file in the `polls` application:

```python
import datetime

from django.test import TestCase
from django.utils import timezone

from .models import Question


class QuestionModelTests(TestCase):
    def test_was_published_recently_with_future_question(self):
        """
        was_published_recently() returns False for questions whose pub_date
        is in the future.
        """
        time = timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)
        future_question = Question(pub_date=time)
        self.assertIs(future_question.was_published_recently(), False)
```

Here we have created a `django.test.TestCase` subclass with a method that creates a `Question` instance with a `pub_date` in the future. We then check the output of `was_published_recently()` - which _ought_ to be False.

## Running tests

In the terminal, we can run our test:

```bash
python manage.py test polls
```

and you'll see something like:

```shell

```

> Different error?

If instead you're getting a `NameError` here, you may have missed a step in `Part 2 <tutorial02-import-timezone>` where we added imports of `datetime` and `timezone` to `polls/models.py`. Copy the imports from that section, and try running your tests again.

What happened is this:

- `manage.py test polls` looked for tests in the `polls` application
- it found a subclass of the `django.test.TestCase` class
- it created a special database for the purpose of testing
- it looked for test methods - ones whose names begin with `test`
- in `test_was_published_recently_with_future_question` it created a `Question` instance whose `pub_date` field is 30 days in the future
- ... and using the `assertIs()` method, it discovered that its `was_published_recently()` returns `True`, though we wanted it to return `False`

The test informs us which test failed and even the line on which the failure occurred.

## Fixing the bug

We already know what the problem is: `Question.was_published_recently()` should return `False` if its `pub_date` is in the future. Amend the method in `models.py`, so that it will only return `True` if the date is also in the past:

```python
def was_published_recently(self):
    now = timezone.now()
    return now - datetime.timedelta(days=1) <= self.pub_date <= now
```

and run the test again:

```bash
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```

After identifying a bug, we wrote a test that exposes it and corrected the bug in the code so our test passes.

Many other things might go wrong with our application in the future, but we can be sure that we won't inadvertently reintroduce this bug, because running the test will warn us immediately. We can consider this little portion of the application pinned down safely forever.

## More comprehensive tests

While we're here, we can further pin down the `was_published_recently()` method; in fact, it would be positively embarrassing if in fixing one bug we had introduced another.

Add two more test methods to the same class, to test the behavior of the method more comprehensively:

```python
def test_was_published_recently_with_old_question(self):
    """
    was_published_recently() returns False for questions whose pub_date
    is older than 1 day.
    """
    time = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1, seconds=1)
    old_question = Question(pub_date=time)
    self.assertIs(old_question.was_published_recently(), False)


def test_was_published_recently_with_recent_question(self):
    """
    was_published_recently() returns True for questions whose pub_date
    is within the last day.
    """
    time = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(hours=23, minutes=59, seconds=59)
    recent_question = Question(pub_date=time)
    self.assertIs(recent_question.was_published_recently(), True)
```

And now we have three tests that confirm that `Question.was_published_recently()` returns sensible values for past, recent, and future questions.

Again, `polls` is a minimal application, but however complex it grows in the future and whatever other code it interacts with, we now have some guarantee that the method we have written tests for will behave in expected ways.

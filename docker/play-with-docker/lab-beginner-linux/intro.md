# Introduction

In this lab, we will look at some basic Docker commands and a simple build-ship-run workflow. We'll start by running some simple containers, then we'll use a Dockerfile to build a custom app. Finally, we'll look at how to use bind mounts to modify a running container as you might if you were actively developing using Docker.

# Introduction

In Golang, closing a channel can be used to communicate completion to the channel's receivers. This challenge will demonstrate how to use a channel to communicate work to be done from the `main()` goroutine to a worker goroutine, and how to close the channel when there are no more jobs for the worker.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

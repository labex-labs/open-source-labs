// _Closing_ a channel indicates that no more values

// In this example we'll use a `jobs` channel to
// communicate work to be done from the `main()` goroutine
// to a worker goroutine. When we have no more jobs for
// the worker we'll `close` the `jobs` channel.
func main() {
    // TODO
	// Here's the worker goroutine. It repeatedly receives
	// from `jobs` with `j, more := <-jobs`. In this
	// special 2-value form of receive, the `more` value
	// will be `false` if `jobs` has been `close`d and all
	// values in the channel have already been received.
	// We use this to notify on `done` when we've worked
	// all our jobs.
	// This sends 3 jobs to the worker over the `jobs`
	// channel, then closes it.
	// We await the worker using the
	// [synchronization](channel-synchronization) approach
	// we saw earlier.

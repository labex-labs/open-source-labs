# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to create temporary files and directories in Go using `os.CreateTemp`, `os.MkdirTemp`, `os.RemoveAll`, and `os.WriteFile`. Temporary files and directories are useful for creating data that is not needed after the program exits and do not pollute the file system over time.

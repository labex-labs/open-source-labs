# Introduction

In Go, maps are built-in associative data types that allow you to store key/value pairs. This challenge will test your ability to create, manipulate, and delete key/value pairs in a map.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Introduction

This challenge aims to test your knowledge of working with XML in Golang. You will be required to create a struct that can be mapped to XML, marshal and unmarshal XML data, and use field tags to define the structure of the XML output.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Generics

## Introduction

This challenge introduces the concept of generics in Golang. Starting from version 1.18, Golang has added support for generics, which allows us to write more flexible and reusable code.

## Problem

The problem to be solved in this challenge is to understand how to define and use generic functions and types in Golang.

## Requirements

- Understand the concept of generics in Golang.
- Know how to define generic functions with type parameters and constraints.
- Know how to define generic types with type parameters.
- Understand how to define methods on generic types.
- Know how to invoke generic functions with type inference.

## TODO

In the provided code, there are two examples of generic functions and types. However, there are some TODOs that need to be completed:

- In the `MapKeys` function, complete the code block that returns a slice of keys from the provided map.
- In the `List` type, complete the `Push` method that adds a new element to the list.

## Example

The output of the provided code should be:

```
keys: [1 2 4]
list: [10 13 23]
```

## Summary

Generics are a powerful feature that allows us to write more flexible and reusable code in Golang. With generics, we can define functions and types that work with any type, as long as they satisfy certain constraints. By using generics, we can reduce code duplication and improve code readability and maintainability.

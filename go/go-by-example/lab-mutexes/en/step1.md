# Mutexes

The problem to be solved in this lab is to increment a named counter in a loop using multiple goroutines, and ensure that the access to the counter is synchronized.

- Use a `Container` struct to hold a map of counters.
- Use a `Mutex` to synchronize access to the `counters` map.
- The `Container` struct should have an `inc` method that takes a `name` string and increments the corresponding counter in the `counters` map.
- The `inc` method should lock the mutex before accessing the `counters` map, and unlock it at the end of the function using a `defer` statement.
- Use the `sync.WaitGroup` struct to wait for the goroutines to finish.
- Use the `fmt.Println` function to print the `counters` map.

```sh
# Running the program shows that the counters
# updated as expected.

# Next we'll look at implementing this same state
# management task using only goroutines and channels.
```

There is the full code below:

```go
// In the previous example we saw how to manage simple
// counter state using [atomic operations](atomic-counters).
// For more complex state we can use a [_mutex_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion)
// to safely access data across multiple goroutines.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// Container holds a map of counters; since we want to
// update it concurrently from multiple goroutines, we
// add a `Mutex` to synchronize access.
// Note that mutexes must not be copied, so if this
// `struct` is passed around, it should be done by
// pointer.
type Container struct {
	mu       sync.Mutex
	counters map[string]int
}

func (c *Container) inc(name string) {
	// Lock the mutex before accessing `counters`; unlock
	// it at the end of the function using a [defer](defer)
	// statement.
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	c.counters[name]++
}

func main() {
	c := Container{
		// Note that the zero value of a mutex is usable as-is, so no
		// initialization is required here.
		counters: map[string]int{"a": 0, "b": 0},
	}

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// This function increments a named counter
	// in a loop.
	doIncrement := func(name string, n int) {
		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			c.inc(name)
		}
		wg.Done()
	}

	// Run several goroutines concurrently; note
	// that they all access the same `Container`,
	// and two of them access the same counter.
	wg.Add(3)
	go doIncrement("a", 10000)
	go doIncrement("a", 10000)
	go doIncrement("b", 10000)

	// Wait for the goroutines to finish
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println(c.counters)
}

```

# Switch

## Introduction

The `switch` statement is a conditional statement that allows you to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression. It is a powerful tool that can simplify your code and make it more readable.

## Problem

In this challenge, you need to complete the `switch` statement to print out the corresponding message based on the input value.

## Requirements

- The `switch` statement must be used to solve the problem.
- The `default` case must be used to handle unexpected input values.

## TODO

Complete the `switch` statement in the `printMessage` function to print out the corresponding message based on the input value.

```go
func printMessage(value int) {
	switch value {
		// TODO: Add cases to print out the corresponding message.
	}
}
```

## Example

Input:

```go
printMessage(1)
```

Output:

```
One
```

Input:

```go
printMessage(5)
```

Output:

```
Unexpected value
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to use the `switch` statement to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression. You also learned how to handle unexpected input values using the `default` case.

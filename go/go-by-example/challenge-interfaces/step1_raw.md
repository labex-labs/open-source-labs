# Interfaces

## Introduction
This challenge is about interfaces in Golang. Interfaces are named collections of method signatures.

## Problem
The problem is to implement an interface in Go, we just need to implement all the methods in the interface. Here we implement `geometry` on `rect`s and `circle`s.

## Requirements
- Implement an interface in Go.
- Implement all the methods in the interface.
- Use a generic `measure` function to work on any `geometry`.
- Use instances of `circle` and `rect` structs as arguments to `measure`.

## TODO
Use the TODO keyword to mark the code that needs to be completed.

```
// TODO: Implement the geometry interface on the rect type.
// TODO: Implement the geometry interface on the circle type.
```

## Example
```
{3 4}
12
14
{5}
78.53981633974483
31.41592653589793
```

## Summary
This challenge is about implementing an interface in Go. We implemented the `geometry` interface on `rect`s and `circle`s and used a generic `measure` function to work on any `geometry`.

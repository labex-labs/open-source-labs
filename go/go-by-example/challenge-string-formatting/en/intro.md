# Introduction

This challenge aims to test your knowledge of string formatting in Golang. You will be required to format different types of data such as integers, floats, strings, and structs using various formatting verbs.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

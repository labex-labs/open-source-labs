# waitgroups

## Problem

The problem to be solved in this challenge is to launch several goroutines and increment the WaitGroup counter for each. Then, we need to wait for all the goroutines launched to finish.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Golang.
- Understanding of concurrency in Golang.
- Familiarity with the `sync` package.

## Example

```sh
$ go run waitgroups.go
Worker 5 starting
Worker 3 starting
Worker 4 starting
Worker 1 starting
Worker 2 starting
Worker 4 done
Worker 1 done
Worker 2 done
Worker 5 done
Worker 3 done

# The order of workers starting up and finishing
# is likely to be different for each invocation.
```

## Solution

```go
// To wait for multiple goroutines to finish, we can
// use a *wait group*.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// This is the function we'll run in every goroutine.
func worker(id int) {
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)

	// Sleep to simulate an expensive task.
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {

	// This WaitGroup is used to wait for all the
	// goroutines launched here to finish. Note: if a WaitGroup is
	// explicitly passed into functions, it should be done *by pointer*.
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Launch several goroutines and increment the WaitGroup
	// counter for each.
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		// Avoid re-use of the same `i` value in each goroutine closure.
		// See [the FAQ](https://golang.org/doc/faq#closures_and_goroutines)
		// for more details.
		i := i

		// Wrap the worker call in a closure that makes sure to tell
		// the WaitGroup that this worker is done. This way the worker
		// itself does not have to be aware of the concurrency primitives
		// involved in its execution.
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			worker(i)
		}()
	}

	// Block until the WaitGroup counter goes back to 0;
	// all the workers notified they're done.
	wg.Wait()

	// Note that this approach has no straightforward way
	// to propagate errors from workers. For more
	// advanced use cases, consider using the
	// [errgroup package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup).
}

```

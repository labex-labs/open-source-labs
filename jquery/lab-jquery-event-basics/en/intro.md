# Introduction

Welcome to the jQuery documentation! This lab will give you an introduction to jQuery Event.

jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selections. When an event occurs, the provided function is executed. Inside the function, this refers to the DOM element that initiated the event.

The event handling function can receive an event object. This object can be used to determine the nature of the event, and to prevent the eventâ€™s default behavior.

  "description": "In Git, a stash is a way to save changes that are not yet ready to be committed. Stashes are useful when you need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task, but you don't want to commit your changes yet. However, sometimes you may need to delete a stash that is no longer needed. In this lab, you will learn how to delete a specific stash in Git.",

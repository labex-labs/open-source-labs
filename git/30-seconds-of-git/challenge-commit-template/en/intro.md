When working on a project, it is important to have a consistent and informative commit message for each change made to the codebase. This helps other developers understand the purpose of the change and makes it easier to track down bugs or revert changes if necessary. In this challenge, you will learn how to set up a commit message template for a Git repository.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

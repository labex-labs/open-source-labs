# View Merged Branches

## Problem

Your task is to print a list of all merged local branches in the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Once you have the list, you should be able to navigate through it using the arrow keys and exit by pressing <kbd>Q</kbd>.

## Example

1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. View the list of merged branches.

This is the final result:

```
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/feature-branch
  remotes/origin/master
```

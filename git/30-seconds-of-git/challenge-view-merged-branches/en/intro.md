In Git, branches are used to develop features or isolate changes made to the codebase. After a branch has served its purpose, it is merged back into the main branch. However, it is important to keep track of which branches have been merged and which have not. This challenge will test your ability to view a list of all merged local branches.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

In Git, the staging area is where changes to files are prepared before they are committed to the repository. Sometimes, you may accidentally add files to the staging area that you don't want to commit. In this challenge, you will learn how to remove files from the staging area using Git.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

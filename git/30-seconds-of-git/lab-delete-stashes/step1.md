# Delete All Stashes

You have been working on a project in a Git repository and have created multiple stashes to save your changes. Now, you want to delete all stashes to start fresh. However, you are not sure how to do it.

To complete this lab, you will use the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the repository directory using the command `cd git-playground`.
2. List all stashes. You should see the current stashes.
3. Delete all stashes at once using the command `git stash clear`.
4. Verify that all stashes have been deleted using the command `git stash list`.

The stashes you just deleted should no longer be there.

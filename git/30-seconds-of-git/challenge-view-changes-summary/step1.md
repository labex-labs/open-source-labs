# View Changes Between Commits

As a developer, you have been working on a project hosted on the `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` repository. You have made several commits to the repository, and you want to view a summary of the changes between two specific commits. However, you are not sure how to do this using Git.

## Tasks

Let's say you want to view the changes between the `HEAD` commit and the commit with the message "Initial commit".

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the `git-playground` repository is located.
2. Display a summary of the changes between the two commits.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```shell
Hang (2):
      Added file1.txt
      Added file2.txt
```

# Sort Git Branches by Date

You have a Git repository with multiple branches, and you want to sort them by date. This will allow you to see which branches have been updated recently and which ones have not. Sorting branches by date can also help you identify branches that may need attention or merging.

## Tasks

For this challenge, let's use the repository from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the directory and configure the identity.
2. Create a branch called `one`, create a file named `hello.txt` and commit it with the commit message "hello.txt".
3. Switch to the branch named `master` and create a branch named `two`.
4. Now, sort the branches by date.

This will display a list of all local branches and sort them based on the date of their last commit. You can use the arrow keys to navigate the list, and press <kbd>Q</kbd> to exit.

This is the finished result:

# Sort Git Branches by Date

## Problem

You have a Git repository with multiple branches, and you want to sort them by date. This will allow you to see which branches have been updated recently and which ones have not. Sorting branches by date can also help you identify branches that may need attention or merging.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.

1. The repository has been cloned, navigate to the directory.
2. Create a branch called `one`, modify the code and commit it.
3. Switch to the branch named `master` and create a branch named `two`.
4. Now, sort the branches by date.

This will display a list of all local branches and sort them based on the date of their last commit. You can use the arrow keys to navigate the list, and press <kbd>Q</kbd> to exit.

This is the finished result:

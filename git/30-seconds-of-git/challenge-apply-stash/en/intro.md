In Git, a stash is a way to save changes that are not ready to be committed yet. It allows you to temporarily save your changes and switch to another branch or work on something else. Once you are ready to continue working on your changes, you can apply the stash and continue where you left off.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

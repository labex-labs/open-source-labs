In Git, a stash is a way to save changes that are not yet ready to be committed. It allows you to temporarily save your work and switch to another branch or commit without losing any changes. When you're ready to continue working on your changes, you can apply the stash to your working directory. In this challenge, you will learn how to apply the latest stash to your Git repository.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

# Rename a Branch

## Problem

As a developer, you may need to rename a branch for various reasons, such as to make it more descriptive or to follow a naming convention. Renaming a branch can be a simple task, but it requires some knowledge of Git commands. In this challenge, you will learn how to rename a branch using Git.

## Example

For this challenge, we will use the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

Suppose you will create a branch named `old-branch` to work on a new feature. After completing the feature, you realize that the branch name is not descriptive enough. You want to rename the branch to `new-branch` to make it more meaningful.

To rename the branch, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the local repository directory.
2. Create a branch named `old-branch` and rename the branch to `new-branch`.
3. Verify that the branch has been renamed.

The output should show the new branch name:

```shell
master
* new-branch
```

# Autocorrect Git Commands

The problem is that developers often mistype git commands, which can lead to errors and slow down their workflow. For example, a developer might accidentally type `git sttaus` instead of `git status`, which will result in an error message. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially when working on large projects with many files and collaborators.

## Example

You will be using a git repository called the `git-playground` directory.

- First, navigate to the cloned repository.
- Second, enable git's autocorrect feature.
- Finally, try typing the wrong git command, for example `git sttaus`.

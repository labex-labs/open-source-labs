When using Git, sometimes you need to write a commit message or make other changes in a text editor. By default, Git uses the system's default text editor, which may not be the one you prefer. In this challenge, you will learn how to configure the text editor used by Git.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">beginner</span> level challenge with a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">96%</span> pass rate.

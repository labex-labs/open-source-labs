# Introduction

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase. Sometimes, developers may make changes to their code that they later decide they don't want to keep. In such cases, it is necessary to discard these changes and revert to the last committed version of the code. This lab will focus on discarding uncommitted changes in Git.

In Git, a remote is a version of your repository that is hosted on a server or another computer. When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin` that points to the original repository. However, sometimes you may need to change the URL of the remote repository. This challenge will test your ability to change the remote URL using Git commands.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

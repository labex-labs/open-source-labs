# View Current Status

As a developer, it's important to know the current status of your Git repository. This includes information about which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are untracked. The `git status` command provides this information in an easy-to-read format.

Your task is to use the `git status` command to view the current status of the Git repository located at `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. You should pay attention to the output of the command and try to understand what it means.

To complete this lab, you will need to clone the Git repository located at `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the root directory of the repository:

```shell
cd git-playground
```

2. View the current status of the Git repository:

```shell
git status
```

This will output the current status of the working tree. You should see information about which branch you are currently on, whether your branch is up to date with the remote repository, and any untracked or modified files.

The output looks like this:

```shell
[object Object]
```

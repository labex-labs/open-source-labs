# Automate Upstream Branch Creation

As a developer, you want to automate the process of creating upstream branches on push to avoid the hassle of manually creating the branch on the remote repository.

## Tasks

To complete the challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` in your GitHub account to automatically create an upstream branch at push time from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the directory and configure the identity.
2. Enable automatic upstream branch creation on push.
3. Create and switch to a branch called `new-feature`, add the `hello.txt` file and write "hello,world" in it, add it to the staging area and commit it with the message "Added hello.txt".
4. Push your changes to a new branch called `new-feature`, which does not exist in the remote repository.

This is the result after completing the challenge:

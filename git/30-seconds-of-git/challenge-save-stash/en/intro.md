Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes made to their codebase. One of the useful features of Git is the ability to create a stash. A stash allows you to save the current state of your working directory and index, so you can switch to a different branch or work on a different feature without losing your changes.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

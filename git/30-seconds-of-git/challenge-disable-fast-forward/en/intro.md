Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. One of the features of Git is fast forward merging, which allows Git to automatically merge branches that have no divergent commits. However, this feature can sometimes cause issues, especially when working on larger projects with multiple contributors. In this challenge, you will learn how to disable fast forward merging by default.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">beginner</span> level challenge with a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">100%</span> pass rate. It has received a <span class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">88.89%</span> positive review rate from learners.

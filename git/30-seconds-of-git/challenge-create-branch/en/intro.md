In Git, a branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Creating a new branch allows you to work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase. In this challenge, you will learn how to create a new branch in Git.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

Git is a popular version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase. However, sometimes it becomes necessary to completely remove a file from the repository's history. This challenge will guide you through the process of purging a file from Git's history.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">beginner</span> level challenge with a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">85.71%</span> pass rate.

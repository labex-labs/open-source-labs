In Git, branches are used to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Sometimes, you may need to copy a file from another branch to the current branch. This challenge will test your ability to copy a file from another branch using Git.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

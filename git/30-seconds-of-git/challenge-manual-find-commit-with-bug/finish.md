# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to use the `git bisect` command to manually find the commit that introduced a bug in a Git repository. By marking commits as either "good" or "bad", you can perform a binary search through the commit history to quickly narrow down the source of the problem. This technique can be incredibly helpful when debugging complex codebases.

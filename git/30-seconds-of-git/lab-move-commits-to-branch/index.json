  "description": "Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes made to their codebase. One of the useful features of Git is the ability to move commits from one branch to another. This can be helpful when you realize that some changes you made to the master branch should have been made on a separate branch. In this lab, you will learn how to move commits from the master branch to a new branch.",

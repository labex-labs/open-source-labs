# Summary

Moving commits from one branch to another can be a helpful feature when working with Git. In this challenge, you learned how to move commits from the `master` branch to a new branch using `git branch`, `git reset`, and `git checkout` commands. Remember that this only works if the changes have only been committed locally and not pushed to the remote.

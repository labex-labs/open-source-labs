Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase. Sometimes, developers may make changes to their code that they later decide they don't want to keep. In such cases, it is necessary to discard these changes and revert to the last committed version of the code. This challenge will focus on discarding uncommitted changes in Git.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

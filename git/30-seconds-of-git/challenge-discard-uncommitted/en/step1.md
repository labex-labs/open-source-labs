# Discard Uncommitted Changes

You have made some changes to your local Git repository, but you have not yet committed them. However, you have decided that you no longer want to keep these changes and want to discard them. The problem is to find a way to discard all uncommitted changes to the current branch.

## Tasks

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` directory. Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the cloned repository.
2. See the changes you have made.
3. Discard all uncommitted changes.
4. Confirm that all changes have been discarded.

This is the result of running `git status`:

```shell
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

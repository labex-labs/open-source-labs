In Git, submodules are repositories within repositories. They allow you to include other repositories as dependencies in your project. When you clone a Git repository that contains submodules, the submodules are not automatically cloned. This can cause issues when trying to build or run the project. In this challenge, you will learn how to clone missing submodules and checkout commits.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

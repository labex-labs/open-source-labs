In Git, a fixup commit is a special type of commit that is used to fix a previous commit. It is typically used when you want to make a small change to a commit that has already been made, without having to create a new commit. Fixup commits are especially useful when you are working on a large project with many contributors, as they allow you to make small changes without disrupting the work of others.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

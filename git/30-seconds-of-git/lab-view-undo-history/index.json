  "description": "Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to track changes to their codebase. However, sometimes we make mistakes and need to undo changes that we've made. Git provides several ways to undo changes, but it can be difficult to keep track of all the actions we've taken. In this challenge, you'll learn how to view the \"undo\" history in Git using the git reflog command.",

# Push Local Changes to Remote

## Problem

As a developer, you may need to push your local changes to a remote repository to share your work with other team members or to deploy your code to a production environment. However, before pushing the changes, you need to ensure that your local branch is up to date with the remote branch. If there are any conflicts between the local and remote branches, you need to resolve them before pushing the changes.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`. You have made some changes to the `master` branch and want to push them to the remote repository.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine from `https://github.com/your-username/git-playground`.
2. Ensure that your local branch is up to date with the remote branch.
3. Once you have pulled the latest changes from the remote branch, you can make your changes to the local branch.
4. After making the changes, stage them.
5. Submit the changes with the message "Added new feature".
6. Finally, push the changes to the remote repository.

This is the result of running `git log`:

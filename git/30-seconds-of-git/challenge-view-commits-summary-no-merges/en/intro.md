When working with Git, it's important to be able to view a summary of all the commits made to a repository. However, sometimes merge commits can clutter up the output and make it difficult to see the actual changes made. In this challenge, you will learn how to view a short summary of all commits excluding merge commits.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

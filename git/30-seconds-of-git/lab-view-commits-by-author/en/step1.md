# View Commits by Author

Your task is to retrieve all commits made by a specific author in the `git-playground` repository. This repository contains a collection of sample projects that you can use to practice your Git skills.

To complete this lab, you will need to use the `git log` command with the `--author` option. This will allow you to filter the commit history to only show commits made by the specified author.

To retrieve all commits made by the author "Hang" in the `git-playground` repository, you can use the following command:

```shell
git log --author="Hang"
```

This will output a list of all commits made by "Hang" in the repository, along with information about the commit message, date, and other details:

```shell

```

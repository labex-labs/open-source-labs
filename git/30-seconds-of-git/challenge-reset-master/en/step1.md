# Reset Local Master Branch to Match Remote

You have been working on a project and have made changes to the local `master` branch. However, you realize that the remote `master` branch has been updated with new changes that you do not have in your local branch. You need to reset the local `master` branch to match the one on the remote.

## Tasks

1. Switch to the `master` branch.
2. Retrieve the latest updates from the remote.
3. View the commit history of the current branch.
4. Reset the local `master` branch to match the one on the remote.
5. Verify that the local `master` branch is now up to date with the remote `master` branch.

This is the finished result:

```shell

```

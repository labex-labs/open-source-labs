  "description": "When working with Git, it is common to have a local branch that is out of sync with its remote counterpart. This can happen when changes are made to the remote branch that are not reflected in the local branch. In such cases, it is necessary to reset the local branch to match the remote branch. This challenge will guide you through the steps to reset the local master branch to match the one on the remote.",

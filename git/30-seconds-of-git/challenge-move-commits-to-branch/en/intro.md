Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes made to their codebase. One of the useful features of Git is the ability to move commits from one branch to another. This can be helpful when you realize that some changes you made to the `master` branch should have been made on a separate branch. In this challenge, you will learn how to move commits from the `master` branch to a new branch.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

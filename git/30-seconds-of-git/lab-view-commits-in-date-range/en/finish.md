# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to view commits in a specific date range using Git. You explored:

- How to clone a Git repository to your local machine
- How to use the basic `git log` command to view commit history
- How to filter commits based on specific date ranges using `--since` and `--until` options
- How to use relative dates like "12 weeks ago" for more flexible filtering
- How to customize the `git log` output with formatting options

These skills are essential for understanding project history, tracking down bugs, and reviewing the development timeline of a codebase. As you continue working with Git, these filtering techniques will help you navigate even large repositories with ease.

# Cloning the Git Repository

To begin exploring Git's date range filtering capabilities, we first need a Git repository to work with. We will use the `git-playground` repository provided by LabEx.

Let's start by cloning the repository:

1. Open your terminal in the LabEx VM.

2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
Cloning into 'git-playground'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 8, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 8 (delta 0), reused 8 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (8/8), done.
```

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd git-playground
```

Now that we have the repository on our local machine, we can start exploring the commit history.

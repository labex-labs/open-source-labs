    "description": "Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. One of the features of Git is fast forward merging, which allows Git to automatically merge branches that have no divergent commits. However, this feature can sometimes cause issues, especially when working on larger projects with multiple contributors. In this challenge, you will learn how to disable fast forward merging by default.",

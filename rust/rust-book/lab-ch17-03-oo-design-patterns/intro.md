# Introduction

Welcome to Implementing an Object-Oriented Design Pattern. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will implement the state pattern in an object-oriented design to create a blog post struct that transitions through different states (draft, review, and published) based on its behavior, ensuring that only published blog posts can return content.

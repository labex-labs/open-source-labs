# Introduction

Welcome to Extensible Concurrency With the Send and Sync Traits. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we explore the two concurrency concepts in Rust - the `Send` and `Sync` traits, which provide extensible concurrency capabilities beyond the standard library.

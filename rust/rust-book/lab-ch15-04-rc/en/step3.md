# Cloning an Rc`<T>` Increases the Reference Count

Let's change our working example in Listing 15-18 so we can see the reference counts changing as we create and drop references to the `Rc<List>` in `a`.

In Listing 15-19, we'll change `main` so it has an inner scope around list `c`; then we can see how the reference count changes when `c` goes out of scope.

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
--snip--

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    println!(
        "count after creating a = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&a)
    );
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!(
        "count after creating b = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&a)
    );
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!(
            "count after creating c = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&a)
        );
    }
    println!(
        "count after c goes out of scope = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&a)
    );
}
```

Listing 15-19: Printing the reference count

At each point in the program where the reference count changes, we print the reference count, which we get by calling the `Rc::strong_count` function. This function is named `strong_count` rather than `count` because the `Rc<T>` type also has a `weak_count`; we'll see what `weak_count` is used for in "Preventing Reference Cycles Using Weak`<T>`".

This code prints the following:

    count after creating a = 1
    count after creating b = 2
    count after creating c = 3
    count after c goes out of scope = 2

We can see that the `Rc<List>` in `a` has an initial reference count of 1; then each time we call `clone`, the count goes up by 1. When `c` goes out of scope, the count goes down by 1. We don't have to call a function to decrease the reference count like we have to call `Rc::clone` to increase the reference count: the implementation of the `Drop` trait decreases the reference count automatically when an `Rc<T>` value goes out of scope.

What we can't see in this example is that when `b` and then `a` go out of scope at the end of `main`, the count is then 0, and the `Rc<List>` is cleaned up completely. Using `Rc<T>` allows a single value to have multiple owners, and the count ensures that the value remains valid as long as any of the owners still exist.

Via immutable references, `Rc<T>` allows you to share data between multiple parts of your program for reading only. If `Rc<T>` allowed you to have multiple mutable references too, you might violate one of the borrowing rules discussed in Chapter 4: multiple mutable borrows to the same place can cause data races and inconsistencies. But being able to mutate data is very useful! In the next section, we'll discuss the interior mutability pattern and the `RefCell<T>` type that you can use in conjunction with an `Rc<T>` to work with this immutability restriction.

# Matching on Different Errors

The code in Listing 9-4 will `panic!` no matter why `File::open` failed.
However, we want to take different actions for different failure reasons. If
`File::open` failed because the file doesn’t exist, we want to create the file
and return the handle to the new file. If `File::open` failed for any other
reason—for example, because we didn’t have permission to open the file—we still
want the code to `panic!` in the same way it did in Listing 9-4. For this, we
add an inner `match` expression, shown in Listing 9-5.

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => {
                match File::create("hello.txt") {
                    Ok(fc) => fc,
                    Err(e) => panic!(
                        "Problem creating the file: {:?}",
                        e
                    ),
                }
            }
            other_error => {
                panic!(
                    "Problem opening the file: {:?}",
                    other_error
                );
            }
        },
    };
}
```

Listing 9-5: Handling different kinds of errors in different ways

The type of the value that `File::open` returns inside the `Err` variant is
`io::Error`, which is a struct provided by the standard library. This struct
has a method `kind` that we can call to get an `io::ErrorKind` value. The enum
`io::ErrorKind` is provided by the standard library and has variants
representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an `io`
operation. The variant we want to use is `ErrorKind::NotFound`, which indicates
the file we’re trying to open doesn’t exist yet. So we match on
`greeting_file_result`, but we also have an inner match on `error.kind()`.

The condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned
by `error.kind()` is the `NotFound` variant of the `ErrorKind` enum. If it is,
we try to create the file with `File::create`. However, because `File::create`
could also fail, we need a second arm in the inner `match` expression. When the
file can’t be created, a different error message is printed. The second arm of
the outer `match` stays the same, so the program panics on any error besides
the missing file error.

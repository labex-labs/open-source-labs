# Introduction

Welcome to Macros. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we explore the concept of macros in Rust, including declarative macros with `macro_rules!` and three kinds of procedural macros: custom `#[derive]` macros, attribute-like macros, and function-like macros.

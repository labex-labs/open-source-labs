# Using Box`<T>` Like a Reference

We can rewrite the code in Listing 15-6 to use a `Box<T>` instead of a reference; the dereference operator used on the `Box<T>` in Listing 15-7 functions in the same way as the dereference operator used on the reference in Listing 15-6.

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
  1 let y = Box::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
  2 assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

Listing 15-7: Using the dereference operator on a `Box<i32>`

The main difference between Listing 15-7 and Listing 15-6 is that here we set `y` to be an instance of a box pointing to a copied value of `x` rather than a reference pointing to the value of `x` \[1\]. In the last assertion \[2\], we can use the dereference operator to follow the box's pointer in the same way that we did when `y` was a reference. Next, we'll explore what is special about `Box<T>` that enables us to use the dereference operator by defining our own box type.

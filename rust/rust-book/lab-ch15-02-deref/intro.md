# Introduction

Welcome to Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References With Deref. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore how implementing the Deref trait allows smart pointers to be treated like regular references and how Rust's deref coercion feature enables working with either references or smart pointers.

# Writing a Failing Test

Because we don't need them anymore, let's remove the `println!` statements from `src/lib.rs` and `src/main.rs` that we used to check the program's behavior. Then, in `src/lib.rs`, we'll add a `tests` module with a test function, as we did in Chapter 11. The test function specifies the behavior we want the `search` function to have: it will take a query and the text to search, and it will return only the lines from the text that contain the query. Listing 12-15 shows this test, which won't compile yet.

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn one_result() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["safe, fast, productive."],
            search(query, contents)
        );
    }
}
```

Listing 12-15: Creating a failing test for the `search` function we wish we had

This test searches for the string `"duct"`. The text we're searching is three lines, only one of which contains `"duct"` (note that the backslash after the opening double quote tells Rust not to put a newline character at the beginning of the contents of this string literal). We assert that the value returned from the `search` function contains only the line we expect.

We aren't yet able to run this test and watch it fail because the test doesn't even compile: the `search` function doesn't exist yet! In accordance with TDD principles, we'll add just enough code to get the test to compile and run by adding a definition of the `search` function that always returns an empty vector, as shown in Listing 12-16. Then the test should compile and fail because an empty vector doesn't match a vector containing the line `"safe, fast, productive."`.

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
pub fn search<'a>(
    query: &str,
    contents: &'a str,
) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    vec![]
}
```

Listing 12-16: Defining just enough of the `search` function so our test will compile

Notice that we need to define an explicit lifetime `'a` in the signature of `search` and use that lifetime with the `contents` argument and the return value. Recall in Chapter 10 that the lifetime parameters specify which argument lifetime is connected to the lifetime of the return value. In this case, we indicate that the returned vector should contain string slices that reference slices of the argument `contents` (rather than the argument `query`).

In other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the `search` function will live as long as the data passed into the `search` function in the `contents` argument. This is important! The data referenced _by_ a slice needs to be valid for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumes we're making string slices of `query` rather than `contents`, it will do its safety checking incorrectly.

If we forget the lifetime annotations and try to compile this function, we'll get this error:

```bash
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
  --> src/lib.rs:31:10
   |
29 |     query: &str,
   |            ----
30 |     contents: &str,
   |               ----
31 | ) -> Vec<&str> {
   |          ^ expected named lifetime parameter
   |
   = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the
signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `query` or `contents`
help: consider introducing a named lifetime parameter
   |
28 ~ pub fn search<'a>(
29 ~     query: &'a str,
30 ~     contents: &'a str,
31 ~ ) -> Vec<&'a str> {
   |
```

Rust can't possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need to tell it explicitly. Because `contents` is the argument that contains all of our text and we want to return the parts of that text that match, we know `contents` is the argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime syntax.

Other programming languages don't require you to connect arguments to return values in the signature, but this practice will get easier over time. You might want to compare this example with the examples in "Validating References with Lifetimes".

Now let's run the test:

```bash
[object Object]
```

Great, the test fails, exactly as we expected. Let's get the test to pass!

# Local Documentation

The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it offline. Run `rustup doc` to open the local documentation in your browser.

```bash
rustup doc
```

Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you're not sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out!

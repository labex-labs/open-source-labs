# Matching with Option`<T>`

In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner `T` value out of the `Some` case when using `Option<T>`; we can also handle `Option<T>` using `match`, as we did with the `Coin` enum! Instead of comparing coins, we'll compare the variants of `Option<T>`, but the way the `match` expression works remains the same.

Let's say we want to write a function that takes an `Option<i32>` and, if there's a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn't a value inside, the function should return the `None` value and not attempt to perform any operations.

This function is very easy to write, thanks to `match`, and will look like Listing 6-5.

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
      1 None => None,
      2 Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five); 3
let none = plus_one(None); 4
```

Listing 6-5: A function that uses a `match` expression on an `Option<i32>`

Let's examine the first execution of `plus_one` in more detail. When we call `plus_one(five)` \[3\], the variable `x` in the body of `plus_one` will have the value `Some(5)`. We then compare that against each match arm:

```rust
None => None,
```

The `Some(5)` value doesn't match the pattern `None` \[1\], so we continue to the next arm:

```rust
Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
```

Does `Some(5)` match `Some(i)` \[2\]? Why yes, it does! We have the same variant. The `i` binds to the value contained in `Some`, so `i` takes the value `5`. The code in the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of `i` and create a new `Some` value with our total `6` inside.

Now let's consider the second call of `plus_one` in Listing 6-5, where `x` is `None` \[4\]. We enter the `match` and compare to the first arm \[1\].

It matches! There's no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the `None` value on the right side of `=>`. Because the first arm matched, no other arms are compared.

Combining `match` and enums is useful in many situations. You'll see this pattern a lot in Rust code: `match` against an enum, bind a variable to the data inside, and then execute code based on it. It's a bit tricky at first, but once you get used to it, you'll wish you had it in all languages. It's consistently a user favorite.

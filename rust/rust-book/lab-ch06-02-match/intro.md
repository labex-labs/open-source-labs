# Introduction

Welcome to The Match Control Flow Construct. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore the powerful `match` control flow construct in Rust, which allows for pattern matching and execution of code based on the matched pattern.

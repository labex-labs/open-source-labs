# Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number

Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them. That step is shown in Listing 2-4. Note that this code won't compile just yet, as we will explain.

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
use rand::Rng;
1 use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    --snip--

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

  2 match guess.3 cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

Listing 2-4: Handling the possible return values of comparing two numbers

First we add another `use` statement \[1\], bringing a type called `std::cmp::Ordering` into scope from the standard library. The `Ordering` type is another enum and has the variants `Less`, `Greater`, and `Equal`. These are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.

Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the `Ordering` type. The `cmp` method \[3\] compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it's comparing `guess` to `secret_number`. Then it returns a variant of the `Ordering` enum we brought into scope with the `use` statement. We use a `match` expression \[2\] to decide what to do next based on which variant of `Ordering` was returned from the call to `cmp` with the values in `guess` and `secret_number`.

A `match` expression is made up of _arms_. An arm consists of a _pattern_ to match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to `match` fits that arm's pattern. Rust takes the value given to `match` and looks through each arm's pattern in turn. Patterns and the `match` construct are powerful Rust features: they let you express a variety of situations your code might encounter and they make sure you handle them all. These features will be covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.

Let's walk through an example with the `match` expression we use here. Say that the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is 38.

When the code compares 50 to 38, the `cmp` method will return `Ordering::Greater` because 50 is greater than 38. The `match` expression gets the `Ordering::Greater` value and starts checking each arm's pattern. It looks at the first arm's pattern, `Ordering::Less`, and sees that the value `Ordering::Greater` does not match `Ordering::Less`, so it ignores the code in that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm's pattern is `Ordering::Greater`, which _does_ match `Ordering::Greater`! The associated code in that arm will execute and print `Too big!` to the screen. The `match` expression ends after the first successful match, so it won't look at the last arm in this scenario.

However, the code in Listing 2-4 won't compile yet. Let's try it:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:22:21
   |
22 |     match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected struct `String`, found integer
   |
   = note: expected reference `&String`
              found reference `&{integer}`
```

The core of the error states that there are _mismatched types_. Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote `let mut guess = String::new()`, Rust was able to infer that `guess` should be a `String` and didn't make us write the type. The `secret_number`, on the other hand, is a number type. A few of Rust's number types can have a value between 1 and 100: `i32`, a 32-bit number; `u32`, an unsigned 32-bit number; `i64`, a 64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to an `i32`, which is the type of `secret_number` unless you add type information elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.

Ultimately, we want to convert the `String` the program reads as input into a real number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do so by adding this line to the `main` function body:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
--snip--

let mut guess = String::new();

io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
    .expect("Failed to read line");

let guess: u32 = guess
    .trim()
    .parse()
    .expect("Please type a number!");

println!("You guessed: {guess}");

match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
    Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
    Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
}
```

We create a variable named `guess`. But wait, doesn't the program already have a variable named `guess`? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of `guess` with a new one. _Shadowing_ lets us reuse the `guess` variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as `guess_str` and `guess`, for example. We'll cover this in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.

We bind this new variable to the expression `guess.trim().parse()`. The `guess` in the expression refers to the original `guess` variable that contained the input as a string. The `trim` method on a `String` instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the string to the `u32`, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press enter to satisfy `read_line` and input their guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user types `5` and presses enter, `guess` looks like this: `5\n`. The `\n` represents "newline." (On Windows, pressing enter results in a carriage return and a newline, `\r\n`.) The `trim` method eliminates `\n` or `\r\n`, resulting in just `5`.

The `parse` method on strings converts a string to another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using `let guess: u32`. The colon (`:`) after `guess` tells Rust we'll annotate the variable's type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the `u32` seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It's a good default choice for a small positive number. You'll learn about other number types in Chapter 3.

Additionally, the `u32` annotation in this example program and the comparison with `secret_number` means Rust will infer that `secret_number` should be a `u32` as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same type!

The `parse` method will only work on characters that can logically be converted into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string contained `A`👍`%`, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it might fail, the `parse` method returns a `Result` type, much as the `read_line` method does (discussed earlier in "Handling Potential Failure with Result" on page XX). We'll treat this `Result` the same way by using the `expect` method again. If `parse` returns an `Err` `Result` variant because it couldn't create a number from the string, the `expect` call will crash the game and print the message we give it. If `parse` can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the `Ok` variant of `Result`, and `expect` will return the number that we want from the `Ok` value.

Let's run the program now:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 58
Please input your guess.
  76
You guessed: 76
Too big!
```

Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured out that the user guessed 76. Run the program a few times to verify the different behavior with different kinds of input: guess the number correctly, guess a number that is too high, and guess a number that is too low.

We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess. Let's change that by adding a loop!

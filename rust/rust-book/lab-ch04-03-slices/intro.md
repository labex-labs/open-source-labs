# Introduction

Welcome to The Slice Type. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we'll be solving a programming problem by writing a function that takes a string of words separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string, and then we'll discuss the limitations of using indices to represent substrings and the solution to this problem using string slices in Rust.

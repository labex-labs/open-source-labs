# Using Box`<T>` to Point to Data on the Heap

The most straightforward smart pointer is a _box_, whose type is written `Box<T>`. Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. What remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data. Refer to Chapter 4 to review the difference between the stack and the heap.

Boxes don't have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap instead of on the stack. But they don't have many extra capabilities either. You'll use them most often in these situations:

- When you have a type whose size can't be known at compile time and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size
- When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won't be copied when you do so
- When you want to own a value and you care only that it's a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type

We'll demonstrate the first situation in "Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes". In the second case, transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a long time because the data is copied around on the stack. To improve performance in this situation, we can store the large amount of data on the heap in a box. Then, only the small amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack, while the data it references stays in one place on the heap. The third case is known as a _trait object_, and "Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types" is devoted to that topic. So what you learn here you'll apply again in that section!

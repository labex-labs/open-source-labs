# The Boolean Type

As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible
values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in
Rust is specified using `bool`. For example:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an `if`
expression. We’ll cover how `if` expressions work in Rust in “Control Flow” on
page XX.

# Introduction

Welcome to Data Types. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore the concept of data types in Rust, where every value is assigned a specific type to determine how it is handled, and in cases where multiple types are possible, type annotations must be added to provide the necessary information to the compiler.

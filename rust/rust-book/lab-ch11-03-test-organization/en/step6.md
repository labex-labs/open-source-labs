# The tests Directory

We create a `tests` directory at the top level of our project directory, next to `src`. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We can then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the files as an individual crate.

Let's create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11-12 still in the `src/lib.rs` file, make a `tests` directory, and create a new file named \_tests/integration`test.rs`. Your directory structure should look like this:

    adder
    ├── Cargo.lock
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── src
    │   └── lib.rs
    └── tests
        └── integration_test.rs

Enter the code in Listing 11-13 into the \_tests/integration`test.rs` file.

Filename: `tests/integration_test.rs`

```rust
use adder;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
```

Listing 11-13: An integration test of a function in the `adder` crate

Each file in the `tests` directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our library into each test crate's scope. For that reason we add `use adder;` at the top of the code, which we didn't need in the unit tests.

We don't need to annotate any code in \_tests/integration`test.rs` with `#[cfg(test)]`. Cargo treats the `tests` directory specially and compiles files in this directory only when we run `cargo test`. Run `cargo test` now:

```bash

```

The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and the doc tests. Note that if any test in a section fails, the following sections will not be run. For example, if a unit test fails, there won't be any output for integration and doc tests because those tests will only be run if all unit tests are passing.

The first section for the unit tests \[1\] is the same as we've been seeing: one line for each unit test (one named `internal` that we added in Listing 11-12) and then a summary line for the unit tests.

The integration tests section starts with the line `Running tests/integration_test.rs` \[2\]. Next, there is a line for each test function in that integration test \[3\] and a summary line for the results of the integration test \[4\] just before the `Doc-tests adder` section starts.

Each integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files in the `tests` directory, there will be more integration test sections.

We can still run a particular integration test function by specifying the test function's name as an argument to `cargo test`. To run all the tests in a particular integration test file, use the `--test` argument of `cargo test` followed by the name of the file:

```bash

```

This command runs only the tests in the \_tests/integration`test.rs` file.

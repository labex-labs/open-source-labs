# Introduction

Welcome to Improving Our I/O Project. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore how iterators can be used to improve the implementation of the `Config::build` function and the `search` function in the I/O project from Chapter 12.

# The Anatomy of a Test Function

At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that's annotated with the `test` attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is the `derive` attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a function into a test function, add `#[test]` on the line before `fn`. When you run your tests with the `cargo test` command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs the annotated functions and reports on whether each test function passes or fails.

Whenever we make a new library project with Cargo, a test module with a test function in it is automatically generated for us. This module gives you a template for writing your tests so you don't have to look up the exact structure and syntax every time you start a new project. You can add as many additional test functions and as many test modules as you want!

We'll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the template test before we actually test any code. Then we'll write some real-world tests that call some code that we've written and assert that its behavior is correct.

Let's create a new library project called `adder` that will add two numbers:

```bash
$ cargo new adder --lib
Created library $(adder) project
$ cd adder
```

The contents of the `src/lib.rs` file in your `adder` library should look like Listing 11-1.

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
  1 #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
      2 assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```

Listing 11-1: The test module and function generated automatically by `cargo new`

For now, let's ignore the top two lines and focus on the function. Note the `#[test]` annotation \[1\]: this attribute indicates this is a test function, so the test runner knows to treat this function as a test. We might also have non-test functions in the `tests` module to help set up common scenarios or perform common operations, so we always need to indicate which functions are tests.

The example function body uses the `assert_eq!` macro \[2\] to assert that `result`, which contains the result of adding 2 and 2, equals 4. This assertion serves as an example of the format for a typical test. Let's run it to see that this test passes.

The `cargo test` command runs all tests in our project, as shown in Listing 11-2.

```bash
[object Object]
```

Listing 11-2: The output from running the automatically generated test

Cargo compiled and ran the test. We see the line `running 1 test` \[1\]. The next line shows the name of the generated test function, called `it_works`, and that the result of running that test is `ok` \[2\]. The overall summary `test result: ok.` \[3\] means that all the tests passed, and the portion that reads `1 passed; 0 failed` totals the number of tests that passed or failed.

It's possible to mark a test as ignored so it doesn't run in a particular instance; we'll cover that in "Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically Requested". Because we haven't done that here, the summary shows `0 ignored`. We can also pass an argument to the `cargo test` command to run only tests whose name matches a string; this is called _filtering_ and we'll cover it in "Running a Subset of Tests by Name". Here we haven't filtered the tests being run, so the end of the summary shows `0 filtered out`.

The `0 measured` statistic is for benchmark tests that measure performance. Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust. See the documentation about benchmark tests at *https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/library-features/test.html* to learn more.

The next part of the test output starting at `Doc-tests adder` \[4\] is for the results of any documentation tests. We don't have any documentation tests yet, but Rust can compile any code examples that appear in our API documentation. This feature helps keep your docs and your code in sync! We'll discuss how to write documentation tests in "Documentation Comments as Tests". For now, we'll ignore the `Doc-tests` output.

Let's start to customize the test to our own needs. First, change the name of the `it_works` function to a different name, such as `exploration`, like so:

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```

Then run `cargo test` again. The output now shows `exploration` instead of `it_works`:

    running 1 test
    test tests::exploration ... ok

    test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0
    filtered out; finished in 0.00s

Now we'll add another test, but this time we'll make a test that fails! Tests fail when something in the test function panics. Each test is run in a new thread, and when the main thread sees that a test thread has died, the test is marked as failed. In Chapter 9, we talked about how the simplest way to panic is to call the `panic!` macro. Enter the new test as a function named `another`, so your `src/lib.rs` file looks like Listing 11-3.

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }

    #[test]
    fn another() {
        panic!("Make this test fail");
    }
}
```

Listing 11-3: Adding a second test that will fail because we call the `panic!` macro

Run the tests again using `cargo test`. The output should look like Listing 11-4, which shows that our `exploration` test passed and `another` failed.

    running 2 tests
    test tests::exploration ... ok
    1 test tests::another ... FAILED

    2 failures:

    ---- tests::another stdout ----
    thread 'main' panicked at 'Make this test fail', src/lib.rs:10:9
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display
    a backtrace

    3 failures:
        tests::another

    4 test result: FAILED. 1 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0
    filtered out; finished in 0.00s

    error: test failed, to rerun pass '--lib'

Listing 11-4: Test results when one test passes and one test fails

Instead of `ok`, the line `test tests::another` shows `FAILED` \[1\]. Two new sections appear between the individual results and the summary: the first \[2\] displays the detailed reason for each test failure. In this case, we get the details that `another` failed because it `panicked at 'Make this test fail'` on line 10 in the `src/lib.rs` file. The next section \[3\] lists just the names of all the failing tests, which is useful when there are lots of tests and lots of detailed failing test output. We can use the name of a failing test to run just that test to more easily debug it; we'll talk more about ways to run tests in "Controlling How Tests Are Run".

The summary line displays at the end \[4\]: overall, our test result is `FAILED`. We had one test pass and one test fail.

Now that you've seen what the test results look like in different scenarios, let's look at some macros other than `panic!` that are useful in tests.

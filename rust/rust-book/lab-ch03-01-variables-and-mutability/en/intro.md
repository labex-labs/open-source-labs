# Introduction

Welcome to **Variables and Mutability**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we explore the concept of mutability in Rust, discussing how variables are immutable by default and how to make them mutable using the `mut` keyword, and highlighting the importance of immutability for safety and concurrency while still acknowledging the usefulness of mutability in certain situations.

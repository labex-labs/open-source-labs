Welcome to Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will learn how to remove code duplication by extracting a function and using generics to operate on abstract types.

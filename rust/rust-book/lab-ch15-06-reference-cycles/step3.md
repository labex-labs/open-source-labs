# Preventing Reference Cycles Using Weak`<T>`{=html}

So far, we've demonstrated that calling `Rc::clone` increases the `strong_count` of an `Rc<T>` instance, and an `Rc<T>` instance is only cleaned up if its `strong_count` is 0. You can also create a _weak reference_ to the value within an `Rc<T>` instance by calling `Rc::downgrade` and passing a reference to the `Rc<T>`. Strong references are how you can share ownership of an `Rc<T>` instance. Weak references don't express an ownership relationship, and their count doesn't affect when an `Rc<T>` instance is cleaned up. They won't cause a reference cycle because any cycle involving some weak references will be broken once the strong reference count of values involved is 0.

When you call `Rc::downgrade`, you get a smart pointer of type `Weak<T>`. Instead of increasing the `strong_count` in the `Rc<T>` instance by 1, calling `Rc::downgrade` increases the `weak_count` by 1. The `Rc<T>` type uses `weak_count` to keep track of how many `Weak<T>` references exist, similar to `strong_count`. The difference is the `weak_count` doesn't need to be 0 for the `Rc<T>` instance to be cleaned up.

Because the value that `Weak<T>` references might have been dropped, to do anything with the value that a `Weak<T>` is pointing to you must make sure the value still exists. Do this by calling the `upgrade` method on a `Weak<T>` instance, which will return an `Option<Rc<T>>`. You'll get a result of `Some` if the `Rc<T>` value has not been dropped yet and a result of `None` if the `Rc<T>` value has been dropped. Because `upgrade` returns an `Option<Rc<T>>`, Rust will ensure that the `Some` case and the `None` case are handled, and there won't be an invalid pointer.

As an example, rather than using a list whose items know only about the next item, we'll create a tree whose items know about their children items _and_ their parent items.

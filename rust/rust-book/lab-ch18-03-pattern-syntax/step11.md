# Ignoring Values in a Pattern

You’ve seen that it’s sometimes useful to ignore values in a pattern, such as
in the last arm of a `match`, to get a catchall that doesn’t actually do

pattern (which you’ve seen), using the `_` pattern within another pattern,
using a name that starts with an underscore, or using `..` to ignore remaining
parts of a value. Let’s explore how and why to use each of these patterns.

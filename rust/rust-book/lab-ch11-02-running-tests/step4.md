# Running a Subset of Tests by Name

Sometimes, running a full test suite can take a long time. If you’re working on
code in a particular area, you might want to run only the tests pertaining to
that code. You can choose which tests to run by passing `cargo test` the name
or names of the test(s) you want to run as an argument.

To demonstrate how to run a subset of tests, we’ll first create three tests for
our `add_two` function, as shown in Listing 11-11, and choose which ones to run.

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn add_two_and_two() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }

    #[test]
    fn add_three_and_two() {
        assert_eq!(5, add_two(3));
    }

    #[test]
    fn one_hundred() {
        assert_eq!(102, add_two(100));
    }
}
```

Listing 11-11: Three tests with three different names

If we run the tests without passing any arguments, as we saw earlier, all the
tests will run in parallel:

```
running 3 tests
test tests::add_three_and_two ... ok
test tests::add_two_and_two ... ok
test tests::one_hundred ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0
filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

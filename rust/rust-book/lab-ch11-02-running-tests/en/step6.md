# Filtering to Run Multiple Tests

We can specify part of a test name, and any test whose name matches that value will be run. For example, because two of our tests' names contain `add`, we can run those two by running `cargo test add`:

```bash

```

This command ran all tests with `add` in the name and filtered out the test named `one_hundred`. Also note that the module in which a test appears becomes part of the test's name, so we can run all the tests in a module by filtering on the module's name.

# Introduction

Welcome to Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore the concept of threads in programming and how they can be used to run code simultaneously, improving performance but adding complexity and potential issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and hard-to-reproduce bugs.

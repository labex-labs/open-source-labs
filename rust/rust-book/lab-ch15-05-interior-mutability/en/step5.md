# Keeping Track of Borrows at Runtime with RefCell`<T>`

When creating immutable and mutable references, we use the `&` and `&mut` syntax, respectively. With `RefCell<T>`, we use the `borrow` and `borrow_mut` methods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to `RefCell<T>`. The `borrow` method returns the smart pointer type `Ref<T>`, and `borrow_mut` returns the smart pointer type `RefMut<T>`. Both types implement `Deref`, so we can treat them like regular references.

The `RefCell<T>` keeps track of how many `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>` smart pointers are currently active. Every time we call `borrow`, the `RefCell<T>` increases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a `Ref<T>` value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by 1. Just like the compile-time borrowing rules, `RefCell<T>` lets us have many immutable borrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.

If we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error as we would with references, the implementation of `RefCell<T>` will panic at runtime. Listing 15-23 shows a modification of the implementation of `send` in Listing 15-22. We're deliberately trying to create two mutable borrows active for the same scope to illustrate that `RefCell<T>` prevents us from doing this at runtime.

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        let mut one_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();
        let mut two_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();

        one_borrow.push(String::from(message));
        two_borrow.push(String::from(message));
    }
}
```

Listing 15-23: Creating two mutable references in the same scope to see that `RefCell<T>` will panic

We create a variable `one_borrow` for the `RefMut<T>` smart pointer returned from `borrow_mut`. Then we create another mutable borrow in the same way in the variable `two_borrow`. This makes two mutable references in the same scope, which isn't allowed. When we run the tests for our library, the code in Listing 15-23 will compile without any errors, but the test will fail:

    ---- tests::it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message stdout ----
    thread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError', src/lib.rs:60:53
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

Notice that the code panicked with the message `already borrowed: BorrowMutError`. This is how `RefCell<T>` handles violations of the borrowing rules at runtime.

Choosing to catch borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time, as we've done here, means you'd potentially be finding mistakes in your code later in the development process: possibly not until your code was deployed to production. Also, your code would incur a small runtime performance penalty as a result of keeping track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time. However, using `RefCell<T>` makes it possible to write a mock object that can modify itself to keep track of the messages it has seen while you're using it in a context where only immutable values are allowed. You can use `RefCell<T>` despite its trade-offs to get more functionality than regular references provide.

# Introduction

Welcome to **Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will learn about modules and how they allow us to organize code within a crate, control the privacy of items, and provide a way to navigate the module tree.

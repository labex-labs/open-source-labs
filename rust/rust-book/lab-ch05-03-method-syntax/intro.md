# Introduction

Welcome to Method Syntax. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, methods are declared with the `fn` keyword and a name, can have parameters and a return value, and are defined within the context of a struct, with the first parameter always being `self` to represent the instance of the struct being called on.

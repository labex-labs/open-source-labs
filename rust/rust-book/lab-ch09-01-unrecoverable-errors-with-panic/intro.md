# Introduction

Welcome to Unrecoverable Errors With Panic. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we learn about panics in Rust and how they can be caused by actions in our code or by explicitly calling the `panic!` macro, and how to use backtraces to track down the source of the panic.

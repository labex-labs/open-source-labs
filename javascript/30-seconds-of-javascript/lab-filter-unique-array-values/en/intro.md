# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of filtering out unique values from an array in JavaScript. We will use the `Set` constructor and the `spread` operator to create an array of unique values and then filter out only the non-unique values using the `filter()` method. This lab will help you understand the importance of filtering unique values in an array and how it can be achieved using simple JavaScript code.

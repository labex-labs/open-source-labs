  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the JavaScript function `elementIsFocused`, which helps determine whether a given element is currently in focus or not. We will learn how to use the `Document.activeElement` property to check if the element is focused and how to implement this function in our web development projects. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to use this function to enhance the user experience of your web applications.",

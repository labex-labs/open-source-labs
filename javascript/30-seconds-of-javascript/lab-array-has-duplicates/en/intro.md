# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if an array has duplicates using JavaScript. We will use the `Set` object to obtain the unique values in the array, then compare the count of these unique values with the length of the original array. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to efficiently check for duplicates in an array using JavaScript.

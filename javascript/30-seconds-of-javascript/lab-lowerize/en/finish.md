# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to convert object keys to lowercase in JavaScript. You have:

1. Explored JavaScript objects and how to access their keys
2. Used the `Object.keys()` method to get all keys from an object
3. Utilized the `reduce()` method to transform an object
4. Created a function to convert all keys of an object to lowercase
5. Enhanced the function to handle nested objects recursively
6. Created a reusable JavaScript module with both functions

These techniques are useful when working with data from different sources where the casing of object keys might be inconsistent. The functions you created can help normalize the data and make it easier to work with.

You can further extend these utilities by adding more functions, such as:

- Converting object keys to uppercase
- Converting keys to camelCase or snake_case
- Filtering objects based on key or value criteria
- Deeply comparing objects for equality

Continue practicing with objects and their manipulation to become more proficient in JavaScript programming.

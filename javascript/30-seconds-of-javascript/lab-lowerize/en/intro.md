# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to convert all the keys of an object to lowercase using JavaScript. This technique is particularly useful when working with data from different sources where the casing of object keys might be inconsistent.

We will utilize several JavaScript methods to accomplish this task:

- `Object.keys()` to get all the keys from an object
- `Array.prototype.reduce()` to transform data into a new object
- `String.prototype.toLowerCase()` to convert strings to lowercase

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a reusable function that can transform any object's keys to lowercase while preserving its values.

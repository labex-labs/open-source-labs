# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of function composition in JavaScript. We will learn how to combine multiple functions into a single function that performs a sequence of operations in a left-to-right order. Through the use of the `pipeFunctions` function, we will discover the benefits of function composition and how it can simplify our code and make it more readable.

  "description": "In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript program that counts the number of weekdays between two given dates. The program uses an array and the reduce method to iterate over the given range of dates, checking if each date is a weekday and incrementing the count accordingly. However, it should be noted that this program does not take official holidays into account.",

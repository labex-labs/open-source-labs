# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to decode a string of data which has been encoded using base-64 encoding in JavaScript. You will learn how to create a `Buffer` for the given string with base-64 encoding and how to use `Buffer.prototype.toString()` to return the decoded string. This lab will provide hands-on experience in decoding base64 encoded strings in JavaScript.

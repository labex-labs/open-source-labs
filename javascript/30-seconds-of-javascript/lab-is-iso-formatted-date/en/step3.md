# Testing with Various Date Formats

Now that we have our basic validation function, let us test it with different date formats to understand how it behaves with various inputs.

## Creating a Test Suite

Let us create a comprehensive test suite to examine different date formats:

1. Create a new file named `dateTester.js`
2. Add the following code:

```javascript
// Import our isISOString function
const isISOString = require("./isISODate");

// Function to test different date strings
function testDate(description, dateString) {
  console.log(`Testing: ${description}`);
  console.log(`Input: "${dateString}"`);
  console.log(`Is ISO Format: ${isISOString(dateString)}`);
  console.log("-----------------------");
}

// Valid ISO date examples
testDate("Standard ISO date with timezone Z", "2023-05-12T14:30:15.123Z");
testDate("ISO date with zero milliseconds", "2020-10-12T10:10:10.000Z");

// Invalid or non-ISO format examples
testDate("Date only (no time component)", "2023-05-12");
testDate("Date and time without milliseconds", "2023-05-12T14:30:15Z");
testDate(
  "Date with time zone offset instead of Z",
  "2023-05-12T14:30:15+01:00"
);
testDate("Invalid date (month 13 does not exist)", "2023-13-12T14:30:15.123Z");
testDate("Non-date string", "Hello World");
```

3. Run the test suite in the terminal:

```bash
node dateTester.js
```

You should see output showing which strings are valid ISO dates and which are not.

## Understanding the Results

Let us analyze what makes each test case valid or invalid:

1. `2023-05-12T14:30:15.123Z` - This is valid because it follows the complete ISO 8601 format with the UTC timezone indicator (Z).

2. `2020-10-12T10:10:10.000Z` - This is also valid, with milliseconds explicitly set to 000.

3. `2023-05-12` - This is a valid date, but not in ISO format because it's missing the time component.

4. `2023-05-12T14:30:15Z` - This appears to be ISO format but is missing the milliseconds, which are required in the strict ISO format.

5. `2023-05-12T14:30:15+01:00` - This uses a timezone offset (+01:00) instead of 'Z'. While this is valid according to ISO 8601, our function requires the exact format produced by `toISOString()`, which always uses 'Z'.

6. `2023-13-12T14:30:15.123Z` - This is an invalid date (month 13 does not exist), so `new Date()` will create an invalid Date object.

7. `Hello World` - This is not a date at all, so `new Date()` will create an invalid Date object.

Our validation function specifically checks two conditions:

1. The string must parse to a valid date (not NaN)
2. When that date is converted back to an ISO string, it must exactly match the original input

This approach ensures we are validating the exact ISO format produced by JavaScript's `toISOString()` method.

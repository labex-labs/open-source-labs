# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of data types in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `getType` function to determine the native type of any given value, whether it is `undefined`, `null`, or an instance of a constructor. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with different data types in JavaScript.

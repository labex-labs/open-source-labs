# Summary

Congratulations on completing the String Byte Size Calculation lab. You have learned:

1. How strings are represented in JavaScript as UTF-16 code units
2. How to use the `Blob` object to calculate a string's byte size
3. The difference between character count and byte size for various types of characters
4. How to create a practical utility for calculating string byte sizes

This knowledge is valuable when working with:

- Web applications that handle user input
- Data storage systems
- Network requests and APIs with size limitations
- Internationalization and multilingual applications

Understanding string byte sizes helps ensure your applications correctly manage data storage and transfer, especially when dealing with international characters, emojis, and special symbols.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the byte size of a string using JavaScript. Understanding the byte size of strings is essential when working with data transfer, storage calculations, or API limitations where data size matters.

We will learn how to convert a string into a `Blob` object and use its properties to determine the exact size in bytes. This technique is commonly used in web development when dealing with file uploads, network requests, or data storage optimization.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of value in JavaScript and how to check if a specified value is undefined. This lab will give you hands-on experience in writing code to determine the presence of undefined values using the strict equality operator. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the isUndefined() function to check for undefined values in your JavaScript programs.

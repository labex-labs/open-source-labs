# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of currying in JavaScript. Currying is a technique that allows us to transform a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. Through this lab, you will gain a deeper understanding of how currying works and how it can be applied in your JavaScript code.

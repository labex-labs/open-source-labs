# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of creating a random number generator in JavaScript. We will use the `Math.random()` method to generate a random value and map it to a desired range using multiplication. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to generate random numbers in JavaScript and how to use them in your projects.

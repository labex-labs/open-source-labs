# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to use the `omit` function in JavaScript to remove specific key-value pairs from an object. We will learn how to use `Object.keys()`, `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` to filter out the provided keys, and how to use `Array.prototype.reduce()` to create a new object with the remaining key-value pairs. This lab is a great way to practice working with objects in JavaScript and to learn how to selectively manipulate them.

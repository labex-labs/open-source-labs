  "title": "Date From Unix Timestamp",
  "description": "In this lab, we will explore how to convert Unix timestamps to JavaScript `Date` objects using JavaScript. We will create a function that takes a Unix timestamp as input and returns a `Date` object that represents the timestamp in human-readable format. This is a common task in web development, especially when working with APIs that return Unix timestamps as data. Through this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in working with timestamps and dates in JavaScript.",

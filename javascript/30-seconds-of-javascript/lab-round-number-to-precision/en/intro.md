# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to round numbers to a given precision using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Math.round()` method and template literals to round a number to a specified number of digits or to an integer value. This knowledge will be useful in situations where we need to display numbers in a more readable format, such as dealing with currency or measurements.

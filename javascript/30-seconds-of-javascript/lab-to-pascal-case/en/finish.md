# Summary

In this lab, you've learned how to convert strings to Pascal case in JavaScript. Here's what you've accomplished:

1. Understood the concept of Pascal case and its applications in programming
2. Learned how to use regular expressions to split strings into words regardless of delimiters
3. Applied string manipulation methods such as `charAt()`, `slice()`, `toUpperCase()`, and `toLowerCase()`
4. Created a robust `toPascalCase` function that handles various input formats
5. Enhanced the function with error handling and exported it as a module
6. Applied the function to practical use cases like converting database field names to JavaScript variables

These skills are useful in many programming scenarios, such as:

- Converting between different naming conventions
- Processing user input into standardized formats
- Working with data from different sources
- Creating consistent naming in your code

You can continue to build on these skills by exploring other string manipulation techniques and applying them to your own projects.

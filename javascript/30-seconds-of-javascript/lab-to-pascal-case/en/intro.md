# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to convert strings to Pascal case using JavaScript. Pascal case is a naming convention commonly used in programming where each word in a compound word begins with an uppercase letter, with no spaces or separators between words. For example, "hello world" becomes "HelloWorld" in Pascal case.

Throughout this lab, we will explore various JavaScript string manipulation methods and regular expressions to create a robust function that can convert any string to Pascal case, regardless of its original format.

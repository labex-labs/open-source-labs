  "description": "In this lab, we will dive into JavaScript programming and create a function called `daysAgo`. This function takes a number as input and calculates the date that is `n` days ago from today. We will use the `Date` constructor, along with various methods such as `Math.abs()` and `Date.prototype.setDate()`, to accomplish this task and return the result as a string in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. By the end of this lab, you will have gained a deeper understanding of working with dates in JavaScript.",

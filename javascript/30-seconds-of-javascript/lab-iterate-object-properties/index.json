  "description": "In this lab, we will be working with iterating over an object's own properties in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to use the `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()` methods to loop through an object's properties and run a callback function for each one. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with objects in JavaScript and how to manipulate their properties.",

# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to work with dates in JavaScript and how to calculate the difference between two dates in seconds. Here is a summary of what you accomplished:

1. You learned how to create and manipulate JavaScript Date objects.
2. You understood how JavaScript handles date arithmetic internally using timestamps.
3. You implemented a function to calculate the difference between two dates in seconds.
4. You created a practical timer application that utilizes the date difference function.

These skills will be valuable for many real-world applications, such as:

- Creating countdown timers for events
- Measuring performance or load times in web applications
- Calculating durations between user actions
- Implementing time-based features in web applications

JavaScript's Date object is a powerful tool for working with dates and times, and knowing how to calculate time differences is an essential skill for web developers.

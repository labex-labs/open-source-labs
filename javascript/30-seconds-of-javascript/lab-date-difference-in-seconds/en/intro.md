# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the difference between two dates in seconds using JavaScript. Understanding how to work with dates and time is essential for many web applications. We will create a function that takes two `Date` objects as input and returns the time difference between them in seconds. This technique is useful for various applications, including measuring time intervals, calculating durations, or creating timers. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of JavaScript Date objects and how to perform time calculations efficiently.

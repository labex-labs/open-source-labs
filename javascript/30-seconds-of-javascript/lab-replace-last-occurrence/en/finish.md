# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to create a JavaScript utility function that replaces the last occurrence of a pattern in a string. Throughout the process, you have gained valuable knowledge about:

- String manipulation methods like `lastIndexOf` and `slice`
- Working with regular expressions in JavaScript
- Handling different types of inputs and edge cases
- Creating and exporting JavaScript modules
- Writing clean, reusable code with proper documentation

The `replaceLast` function you have built is a practical utility that can be used in many real-world scenarios such as file path manipulation, URL modifications, and text processing. This type of string manipulation is commonly needed but not directly available in JavaScript's standard library.

By understanding the concepts and techniques covered in this lab, you are now better equipped to solve similar string manipulation problems in your future programming projects.

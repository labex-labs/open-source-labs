# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore string manipulation in JavaScript by implementing a `replaceLast` function. Unlike the built-in `replace` method which replaces the first occurrence of a pattern, our function will specifically target the last occurrence. This capability is useful in many real-world scenarios such as updating file extensions, modifying URLs, or cleaning up text.

Throughout this lab, you will learn about string methods, regular expressions, and how to combine them to create a useful utility function. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of JavaScript string manipulation techniques and a reusable function for your coding projects.

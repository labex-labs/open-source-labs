# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a function called `formatDuration` that helps us convert a given number of milliseconds into a human-readable format. We will learn how to use mathematical operations to extract the appropriate values for days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. We will also use various array methods like `filter`, `map`, and `join` to create a string that displays the duration in a user-friendly way. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to manipulate and format time-related data in JavaScript.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of type checking in JavaScript. Specifically, we will focus on the `typeof` operator and how it can be used to check whether a given value is a string primitive. Through a series of exercises and challenges, you will gain a deeper understanding of this fundamental aspect of JavaScript programming.

  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the concept of shallow cloning in JavaScript. Shallow cloning creates a new object with all of the properties of the original object, but the properties themselves are not cloned. Instead, they are copied by reference, which means that any changes made to the properties of the original object will also be reflected in the cloned object. Through this lab, we will understand how to create shallow clones of objects using the `Object.assign()` method in JavaScript.",

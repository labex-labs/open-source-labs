# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the logical AND operator in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `&&` operator to check if two given values are true and practice implementing the `and` function using this operator. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use logical AND in your JavaScript code to improve its functionality. Let's get started!

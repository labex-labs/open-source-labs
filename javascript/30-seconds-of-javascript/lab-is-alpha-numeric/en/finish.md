# Summary

In this lab, we explored how to check if a string contains only alphanumeric characters in JavaScript. We learned several key concepts:

1. What alphanumeric characters are (letters A-Z, a-z, and digits 0-9)
2. How to use regular expressions to validate string patterns
3. Breaking down and understanding regex patterns like `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/`
4. Creating an interactive validation tool using Node.js
5. Exploring alternative methods for checking alphanumeric strings

The ability to validate string content is a fundamental skill in programming, useful for:

- Form validation in web applications
- Data cleaning and processing
- Security checks to prevent injection attacks
- File name or user input validation

You can extend what you learned by:

- Adding more validation rules (e.g., minimum length, special character requirements)
- Creating a more comprehensive validation library
- Integrating these validation functions into a web application

The regular expression approach we used is concise and efficient, but remember that understanding the alternatives gives you more tools in your programming toolkit.

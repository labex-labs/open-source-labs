# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to check if a string contains only alphanumeric characters using JavaScript. Alphanumeric characters include letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9). This is a common task in form validation, data processing, and many other programming scenarios.

We will create a JavaScript function that uses regular expressions to determine if a string is alphanumeric. By the end of this lab, you will understand how to implement this check and how regular expressions can be used to validate string patterns in JavaScript.

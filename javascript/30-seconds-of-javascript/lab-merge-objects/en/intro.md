# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the process of merging objects in JavaScript. The lab will walk you through the steps of creating a new object by combining two or more objects. You will learn how to use Array.prototype.reduce() and Object.keys() to iterate over objects and keys, and Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() and Array.prototype.concat() to merge values for existing keys.

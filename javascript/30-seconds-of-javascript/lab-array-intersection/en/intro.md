# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of array intersection in JavaScript. The main objective of this lab is to help you understand how to find common elements between two arrays while removing any duplicate values. You will learn how to use the `Set` data structure and the `Array.prototype.filter()` method to achieve this functionality.

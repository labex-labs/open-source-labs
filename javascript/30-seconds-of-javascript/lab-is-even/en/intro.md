# Introduction

In this lab, we will delve into the world of JavaScript programming and learn how to write a function to determine whether a given number is even or odd. The lab will guide you through the steps of using the modulo operator to check whether a number is divisible by 2, and then returning true if it is even, or false if it is odd. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of basic programming concepts in JavaScript and how to write functions for simple tasks.

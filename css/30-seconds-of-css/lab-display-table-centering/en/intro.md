# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to center a child element within its parent element using `display: table`. By using this technique, we can easily achieve both vertical and horizontal centering without having to resort to complex positioning or JavaScript. This is a useful skill to have when designing responsive layouts for websites and applications.

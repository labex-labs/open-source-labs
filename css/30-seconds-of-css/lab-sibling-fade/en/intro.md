# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to implement a CSS effect called "Sibling Fade". This effect allows the siblings of a hovered item to fade out, while the hovered item remains fully visible. We will use CSS selectors and transitions to achieve this effect in a simple and elegant way. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use CSS to create dynamic and interactive web content.

# Understanding the Project Files

Before we start creating our checkerboard pattern, let's examine the project files that have been provided in the VM.

1. Open the `index.html` file in the editor by clicking on it in the file explorer panel.

The initial HTML file should look like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Checkerboard Pattern</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- You will add your code here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

2. Now open the `style.css` file in the editor.

The initial CSS file should be empty or contain minimal styles:

```css
/* CSS styles will be added here */
```

3. Let's start our development server to see the initial state of our webpage.

To view your webpage in the browser, click on the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner of the editor. This will start a live server and display your webpage in the **Web 8080** tab.

You should see a blank page at this point, as we haven't added any content or styles yet.

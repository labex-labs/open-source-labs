# Summary

Congratulations on completing the Checkerboard Background Pattern lab. In this lab, you have:

- Created an HTML structure to host your checkerboard pattern
- Learned how to use CSS linear gradients to create patterns
- Combined multiple gradients at different angles to create a checkerboard effect
- Applied sizing and repeating properties to perfect the pattern

This checkerboard pattern demonstrates a powerful CSS technique that can be applied to many web design projects. The approach you've learned - using gradients instead of images - results in faster loading times and better scalability for your web pages.

You can now use this knowledge to create other patterns and visual effects using CSS gradients. You might consider experimenting with:

- Different colors for the checkerboard
- Changing the size of the squares
- Using different angles for the gradients
- Creating other geometric patterns like stripes or dots

The techniques you've learned in this lab provide a foundation for creating sophisticated background patterns with pure CSS.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `:fullscreen` CSS pseudo-element selector to apply styles to an element when it is in fullscreen mode. We will create a button using `Element.requestFullscreen()` to make the element fullscreen for the purpose of previewing the style. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create fullscreen elements with custom styles using CSS.

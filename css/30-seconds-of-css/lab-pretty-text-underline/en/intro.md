# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a pretty text underline that does not clip descenders using CSS. By using a combination of text-shadow and background-image with linear-gradient, we can create a gradient that will act as the actual underline while ensuring that the text remains selectable. This technique provides a more visually appealing alternative to text-decoration: underline.

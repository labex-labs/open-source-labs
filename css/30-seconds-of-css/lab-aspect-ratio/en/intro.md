# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a responsive container with a specified aspect ratio using CSS. You will be introduced to the `--aspect-ratio` custom property and how to use the `calc()` function to calculate the container's height. You will also learn how to set the child element to maintain the aspect ratio using the `object-fit: cover` property. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create visually appealing and responsive containers on your web pages.

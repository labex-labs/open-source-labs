# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the use of CSS to trim multiline text to a specified number of lines. By using the `-webkit-line-clamp` property and other related CSS properties, we can effectively limit the number of lines displayed in a block of text, making it more visually appealing and easier to read. Through this lab, you will learn how to implement this technique in your web design projects.

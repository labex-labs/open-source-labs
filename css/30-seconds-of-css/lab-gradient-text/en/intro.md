# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of gradient text in CSS. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to create gradient text using the `linear-gradient()` function, as well as how to use the `webkit-text-fill-color` and `webkit-background-clip` properties to fill the text with a gradient background. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create visually appealing gradient text that can enhance the design of your web pages.

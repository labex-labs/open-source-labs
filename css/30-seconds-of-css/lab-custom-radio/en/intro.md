# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore CSS programming concepts by creating a custom radio button with animation on state change. The lab will guide you through the process of using flexbox to create a layout for the radio buttons, resetting the styles on the `<input>` element, and using the `::before` element to create the inner circle of the radio button. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of CSS styling and animation techniques.

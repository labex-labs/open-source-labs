# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a 3-tile layout using `display: inline-block`. You will use `width` and `calc` to evenly divide the container into 3 columns and set `font-size` to avoid whitespace. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create a clean and responsive tiled layout without using `float`, `flex` or `grid`.

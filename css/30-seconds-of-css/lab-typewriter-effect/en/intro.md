# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a typewriter effect animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The typewriter effect is a popular animation that simulates the appearance of text being typed on a page, one character at a time. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create your own typewriter effect animation to add a dynamic and engaging element to your web projects.

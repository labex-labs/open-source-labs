# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to truncate multiline text that exceeds the dimensions of its container. This technique is useful for displaying excerpts of longer text while maintaining a clean and organized design. By using CSS properties such as `overflow`, `height`, and `background`, we can create a visually pleasing truncation effect that enhances the user experience.

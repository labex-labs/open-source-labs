# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a zig zag background pattern using CSS. By using `linear-gradient()` and adjusting the `background-size` and `background-position`, we will be able to create a visually appealing pattern that can be used on various elements of a website. This lab will help improve our CSS skills and give us a better understanding of how to use CSS to create unique designs.

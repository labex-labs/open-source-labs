# Summary

Congratulations on completing the Zoom in Zoom Out Animation lab! In this lab, you have learned:

1. How to structure HTML for a CSS animation
2. How to style elements using basic CSS properties
3. How to create keyframes animations that define the stages of an animation
4. How to apply animations to elements using the animation property
5. How to customize animations by adjusting timing, easing, and combining multiple property changes

These CSS animation techniques can be applied to create engaging user interfaces that respond to user interactions or draw attention to important elements on your web pages.

To continue your learning journey, consider exploring other animation properties like `animation-delay`, `animation-direction`, and `animation-fill-mode`. You can also experiment with animating different CSS properties beyond transform, such as opacity, position, and size.

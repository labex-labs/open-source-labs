In this lab, we will explore CSS animations by creating a simple yet effective zoom in and zoom out effect. CSS animations allow us to add dynamic visual effects to web pages without using JavaScript. By the end of this lab, you will understand how to use CSS keyframes and animation properties to create smooth transitions that can enhance user experience on your websites.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to add a fading gradient to an overflowing element using CSS. The purpose of this lab is to create a visual cue for users that there is more content to be scrolled. By using the `::after` pseudo-element and `linear-gradient()` function, we can create a gradient that fades from transparent to white, indicating that there is additional content to be viewed.

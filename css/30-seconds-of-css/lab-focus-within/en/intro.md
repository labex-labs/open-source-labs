# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `:focus-within` pseudo-class in CSS, which allows us to apply styles to a parent element when any of its child elements are focused. We will use this feature to create a visually appealing form that changes its appearance when the user interacts with it. Through this lab, you will gain a better understanding of how to enhance the user experience by using CSS to create interactive forms.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the `clearfix` technique in CSS. This technique is used to ensure that an element clears its floated children. We will explore how to implement this technique in our code and discuss its limitations. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use `clearfix` in your CSS layouts.

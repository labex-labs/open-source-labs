# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a card with an image cutout using HTML and CSS. This lab will teach you how to add a colored background to a container element, create a card with an image and other content, and use the ::before pseudo-element to add a border around the figure element, creating the illusion of a cutout in the card. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to create visually appealing cards with image cutouts.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a constant width to height ratio for elements with varying widths. By using the `padding-top` property on a `::before` pseudo-element, we can ensure that the height of the element remains proportionate to its width. This technique can be used to create responsive squares and other shapes with specific aspect ratios.

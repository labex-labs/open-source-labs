# Plot results

We will plot the results of the `GridSearchCV` using a bar chart. This will allow us to compare the accuracy of different feature reduction techniques.

```python
import pandas as pd

mean_scores = np.array(grid.cv_results_["mean_test_score"])
# scores are in the order of param_grid iteration, which is alphabetical
mean_scores = mean_scores.reshape(len(C_OPTIONS), -1, len(N_FEATURES_OPTIONS))
# select score for best C
mean_scores = mean_scores.max(axis=0)
# create a dataframe to ease plotting
mean_scores = pd.DataFrame(
    mean_scores.T, index=N_FEATURES_OPTIONS, columns=reducer_labels
)

ax = mean_scores.plot.bar()
ax.set_title("Comparing feature reduction techniques")
ax.set_xlabel("Reduced number of features")
ax.set_ylabel("Digit classification accuracy")
ax.set_ylim((0, 1))
ax.legend(loc="upper left")

plt.show()
```

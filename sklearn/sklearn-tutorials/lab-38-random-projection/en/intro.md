# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore random projection in dimensionality reduction using the scikit-learn library. Random projection is a technique that can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving the pairwise distances between samples. This can be useful for speeding up computations and reducing memory usage in machine learning algorithms.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

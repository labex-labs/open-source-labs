# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the functionality and usage of multiclass and multioutput algorithms in scikit-learn. Multiclass classification is a classification task where samples are assigned to more than two classes. Multioutput classification, on the other hand, predicts multiple properties for each sample. We will cover the following topics:

1. Multiclass Classification
2. Multilabel Classification
3. Multiclass-Multioutput Classification
4. Multioutput Regression

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

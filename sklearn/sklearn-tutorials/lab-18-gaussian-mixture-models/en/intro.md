# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and how to use them for clustering and density estimation using the scikit-learn library in Python. Gaussian mixture models are a type of probabilistic model that assume data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. They are a generalization of k-means clustering that incorporate information about the covariance structure of the data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

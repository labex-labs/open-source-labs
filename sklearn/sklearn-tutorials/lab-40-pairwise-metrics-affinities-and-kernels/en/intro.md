# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` submodule in scikit-learn. This module provides utilities for calculating pairwise distances and affinities between sets of samples.

We will learn about different pairwise metrics and kernels, their definitions, and how to use them in scikit-learn.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

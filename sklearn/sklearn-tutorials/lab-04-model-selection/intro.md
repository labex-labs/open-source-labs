# Introduction

In machine learning, model selection is the process of choosing the best model for a given dataset. It involves selecting the appropriate estimator and tuning its parameters to achieve optimal performance. This tutorial will guide you through the process of model selection in scikit-learn.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

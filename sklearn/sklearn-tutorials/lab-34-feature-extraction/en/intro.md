# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to perform feature extraction using the scikit-learn library. Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It involves extracting relevant information from different types of data such as text and images.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

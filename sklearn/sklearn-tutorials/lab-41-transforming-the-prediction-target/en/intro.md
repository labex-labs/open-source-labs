# Introduction

In machine learning, it is often necessary to transform the prediction target before training a model. This can include tasks such as converting multiclass labels into a binary indicator matrix or encoding non-numerical labels into numerical labels.

In this lab, we will explore the various techniques provided by the `sklearn.preprocessing` module in scikit-learn to transform the prediction target.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

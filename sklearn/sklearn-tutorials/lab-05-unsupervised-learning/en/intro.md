# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering and decomposition. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where we don't have labeled data to train on. Instead, we try to find patterns or structures in the data without any prior knowledge. Clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique used to group similar observations together. Decomposition, on the other hand, is used to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data by extracting the most important features or components.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

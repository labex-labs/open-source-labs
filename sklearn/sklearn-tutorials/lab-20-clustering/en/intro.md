# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique. Clustering is used to group similar data points together based on their features or attributes, without the need for labeled training data. There are various clustering algorithms available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this lab, we will focus on the k-means clustering algorithm.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

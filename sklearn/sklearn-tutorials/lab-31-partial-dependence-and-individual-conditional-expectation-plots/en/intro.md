# Introduction

Partial dependence plots (PDP) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots are useful tools for visualizing and analyzing the interaction between the target response and a set of input features. PDPs show the dependence between the target response and the input features, while ICE plots visualize the dependence of the prediction on a feature for each individual sample. These plots help us understand the relationship between the target response and the input features.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and its implementation using the scikit-learn library in Python. KRR combines ridge regression with the kernel trick to learn a linear function in the space induced by the kernel. It is a non-linear regression method that can handle non-linear relationships between input and output variables.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore isotonic regression using scikit-learn. Isotonic regression is a technique that fits a non-decreasing function to one-dimensional data. It is useful when you have data that does not satisfy the assumption of linearity in a regression model.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

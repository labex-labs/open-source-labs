# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the setting and the estimator object in scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will learn about datasets, which are represented as 2D arrays, and how to preprocess them for scikit-learn. We will also explore the concept of estimator objects, which are used to learn from data and make predictions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

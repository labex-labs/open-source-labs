# Introduction

Covariance estimation is an important statistical technique used to estimate the covariance matrix of a population. The covariance matrix describes the relationship between variables in a dataset and can provide valuable insights into the data's scatter plot shape. In this lab, we will explore various methods for estimating the covariance matrix using the `sklearn.covariance` package in Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Feature scaling is an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. It involves rescaling each feature such that it has a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0. In this lab, we will explore the importance of feature scaling and its effect on machine learning models using the scikit-learn library in Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

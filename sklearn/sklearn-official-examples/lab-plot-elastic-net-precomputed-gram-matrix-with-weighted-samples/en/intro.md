# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to precompute the gram matrix while using weighted samples with an ElasticNet. It is important to note that if weighted samples are used, the design matrix must be centered and then rescaled by the square root of the weight vector before the gram matrix is computed.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

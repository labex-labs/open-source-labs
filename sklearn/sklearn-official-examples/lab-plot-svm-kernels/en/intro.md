# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to use SVM-Kernels to classify data-points. SVM-Kernels are especially useful when the data-points are not linearly separable. We will use Python scikit-learn to carry out this task.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

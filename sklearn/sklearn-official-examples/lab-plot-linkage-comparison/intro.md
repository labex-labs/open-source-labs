# Introduction

In this lab, we will be using Python's scikit-learn library to perform hierarchical clustering on a few toy datasets. Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering where you build a hierarchy of clusters, either in a top-down or bottom-up fashion. The goal of hierarchical clustering is to find clusters of points that are similar to each other, and dissimilar to points in other clusters.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

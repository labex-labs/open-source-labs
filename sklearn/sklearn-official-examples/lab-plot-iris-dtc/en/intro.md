# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Iris dataset and decision trees to classify the types of iris flowers. We will first visualize the decision boundaries of decision trees trained on pairs of features of the Iris dataset. Next, we will display the structure of a single decision tree trained on all the features of the Iris dataset.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

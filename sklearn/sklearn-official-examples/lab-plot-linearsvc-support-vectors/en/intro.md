# Introduction

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. SVM tries to find the best possible boundary that separates different classes of data. In this lab, we will learn how to plot the support vectors of LinearSVC.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

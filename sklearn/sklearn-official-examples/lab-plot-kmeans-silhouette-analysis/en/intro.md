# Introduction

Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together based on their features. The Silhouette Method is a commonly used technique to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. In this lab, we will use the Silhouette Method to determine the optimal number of clusters using the KMeans algorithm.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

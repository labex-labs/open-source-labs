# Introduction

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together. It starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then combines these clusters iteratively based on their similarity until all data points belong to a single cluster. In this lab, we will explore the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local structure in the data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

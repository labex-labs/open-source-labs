# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the different strategies available in the `KBinsDiscretizer` class of the Python scikit-learn library. `KBinsDiscretizer` is a class for discretizing continuous features into categorical features by binning the continuous data. We will visualize the different strategies by applying them to different datasets.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab applies different unsupervised matrix decomposition (dimension reduction) methods from the module `sklearn.decomposition` to the Olivetti faces dataset. The Olivetti faces dataset consists of 400 faces of size 64x64 pixels from 40 individuals, each captured with different facial expressions and lighting conditions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

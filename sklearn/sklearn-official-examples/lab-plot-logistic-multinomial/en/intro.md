# Introduction

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that can be used for binary and multi-class classification problems. In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to plot the decision surface of two logistic regression models, namely the multinomial logistic regression and the one-vs-rest logistic regression. We will use a 3-class dataset and plot the decision boundary of the two models to compare their performance.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

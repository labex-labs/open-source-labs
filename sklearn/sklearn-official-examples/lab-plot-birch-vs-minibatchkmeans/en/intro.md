# Introduction

This lab compares the timing of two clustering algorithms, BIRCH and MiniBatchKMeans, on a synthetic dataset. Both algorithms are scalable and can efficiently cluster large datasets. The synthetic dataset has 25,000 samples and two features generated using make_blobs.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to perform novelty detection. LOF is an unsupervised anomaly detection method that identifies the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. It considers the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors as outliers.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

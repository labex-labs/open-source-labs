# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Kernel PCA to denoise images. The idea is to learn a PCA basis on noise-free images and use it to reconstruct and denoise the noisy images. We use USPS digits dataset for this purpose.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

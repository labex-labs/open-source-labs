# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Python's scikit-learn library to perform robust linear estimator fitting. We will fit a sine function with a polynomial of order 3 for values close to zero and demo the robust fitting in different situations. We will use the median absolute deviation to non-corrupt new data to judge the quality of the prediction.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

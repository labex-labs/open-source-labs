# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the scikit-learn library in Python to estimate robust covariance matrices. The tutorial will introduce you to the concept of robust covariance estimation and demonstrate how it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of datasets that are contaminated with outliers.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

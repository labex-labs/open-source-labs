# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a famous dataset that contains information about the length and width of the sepal and petal of three different species of Iris flowers. We will use scikit-learn to implement GPC, which is a probabilistic approach for classification tasks.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

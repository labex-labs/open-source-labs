# Introduction

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering method used to group similar objects together. It starts with each object as its own cluster, and then iteratively merges the most similar clusters together until a stopping criterion is met. In this lab, we will demonstrate the effect of different metrics on the hierarchical clustering using agglomerative clustering algorithm.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

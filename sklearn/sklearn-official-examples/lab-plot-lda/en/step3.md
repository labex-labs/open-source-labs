# Train and Test Classifiers

We will train and test each classifier to see how they perform on the generated data. We will repeat this process multiple times to get an average accuracy score.

```python
n_train = 20  # samples for training
n_test = 200  # samples for testing
n_averages = 50  # how often to repeat classification
n_features_max = 75  # maximum number of features
step = 4  # step size for the calculation

acc_clf1, acc_clf2, acc_clf3 = [], [], []
n_features_range = range(1, n_features_max + 1, step)

for n_features in n_features_range:
    score_clf1, score_clf2, score_clf3 = 0, 0, 0
    for _ in range(n_averages):
        X, y = generate_data(n_train, n_features)

        clf1.fit(X, y)
        clf2.fit(X, y)
        clf3.fit(X, y)

        X, y = generate_data(n_test, n_features)
        score_clf1 += clf1.score(X, y)
        score_clf2 += clf2.score(X, y)
        score_clf3 += clf3.score(X, y)

    acc_clf1.append(score_clf1 / n_averages)
    acc_clf2.append(score_clf2 / n_averages)
    acc_clf3.append(score_clf3 / n_averages)
```

# Introduction

In this lab, we will be using the Nearest Neighbors Classification algorithm to classify data points in a 2-dimensional space. We will be using the Iris dataset, which is a commonly used dataset in machine learning. We will visualize the decision boundaries for each class and observe how the algorithm performs when different weights are used.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

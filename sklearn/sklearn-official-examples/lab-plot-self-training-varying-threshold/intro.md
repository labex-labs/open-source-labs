# Introduction

This lab illustrates the effect of varying threshold on self-training. The `breast_cancer` dataset is loaded, and labels are deleted such that only 50 out of 569 samples have labels. A `SelfTrainingClassifier` is fitted on this dataset, with varying thresholds.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

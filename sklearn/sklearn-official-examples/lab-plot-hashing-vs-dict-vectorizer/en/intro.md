# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore text vectorization, which is the process of representing non-numerical input data (such as dictionaries or text documents) as vectors of real numbers. We will compare two methods, `FeatureHasher` and `DictVectorizer`, by using both methods to vectorize text documents that are preprocessed (tokenized) with the help of a custom Python function.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

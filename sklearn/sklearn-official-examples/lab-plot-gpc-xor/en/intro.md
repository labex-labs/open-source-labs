# Introduction

In this lab, we will go through an example of Gaussian process classification (GPC) on XOR dataset using scikit-learn. We will compare the results obtained by using a stationary, isotropic kernel (RBF) and a non-stationary kernel (DotProduct).

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

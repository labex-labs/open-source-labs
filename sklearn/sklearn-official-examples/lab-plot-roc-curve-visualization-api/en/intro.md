# Introduction

Scikit-learn is a popular Python library that provides a simple and efficient API for machine learning tasks. One of the key features of scikit-learn is its built-in visualization API, which makes it easy to generate visualizations for machine learning models. In this lab, we will explore how to use the scikit-learn visualization API to compare ROC curves for two different classifiers.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

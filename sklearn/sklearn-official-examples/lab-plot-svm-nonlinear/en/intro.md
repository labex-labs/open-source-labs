# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of performing binary classification using non-linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The target to predict is an XOR of the inputs. The color map illustrates the decision function learned by the SVM. We will use Python scikit-learn library for this task.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

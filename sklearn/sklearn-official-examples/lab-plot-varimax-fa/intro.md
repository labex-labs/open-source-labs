# Introduction

Factor Analysis is a statistical method used to uncover patterns in data. It is often used to identify latent variables that explain correlations among observed variables. In this lab, we will use the Iris dataset to illustrate how Factor Analysis can be used to reveal the underlying structure of the data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

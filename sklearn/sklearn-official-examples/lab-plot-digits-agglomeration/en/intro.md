# Introduction

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use feature agglomeration to merge similar features in a dataset. Feature agglomeration is useful when working with high-dimensional datasets by reducing the number of features while preserving the most important information.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

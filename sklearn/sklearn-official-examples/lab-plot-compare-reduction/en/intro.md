# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the use of `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` in scikit-learn to optimize over different classes of estimators in a single CV run. We will be using a support vector classifier to predict hand-written digits from the popular MNIST dataset.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

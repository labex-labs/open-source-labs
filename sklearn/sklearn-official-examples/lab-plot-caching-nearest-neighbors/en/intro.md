# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to precompute the k nearest neighbors before using them in KNeighborsClassifier. KNeighborsClassifier can compute the nearest neighbors internally, but precomputing them can have several benefits, such as finer parameter control, caching for multiple use, or custom implementations. Here we use the caching property of pipelines to cache the nearest neighbors graph between multiple fits of KNeighborsClassifier.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

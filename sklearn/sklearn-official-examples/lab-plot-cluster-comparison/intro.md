# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the characteristics of different clustering algorithms on datasets that are "interesting" but still in 2D. The parameters of each of these dataset-algorithm pairs have been tuned to produce good clustering results. While these examples give some intuition about the algorithms, this intuition might not apply to very high dimensional data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

The prediction latency of machine learning models is a crucial factor in real-world applications. In this lab, we will use Scikit-Learn estimators to benchmark the prediction latency of various regressors. We will measure the latency when doing predictions either in bulk or atomic mode. The plots will represent the distribution of the prediction latency as a boxplot.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will be using cross-validation with linear models. We will be using the diabetes dataset and applying GridSearchCV to find the best alpha value for Lasso regression. We will then plot the errors and use LassoCV to see how much we can trust the selection of alpha.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

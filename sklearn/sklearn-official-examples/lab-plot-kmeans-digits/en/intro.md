# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the K-Means clustering algorithm using the scikit-learn library in Python. We will use the handwritten digits dataset, which contains 64 features representing an 8x8 image of a digit, and we will try to group the images together based on the digit they represent. We will compare the different initialization methods for K-Means and evaluate the performance of the clustering using various metrics.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

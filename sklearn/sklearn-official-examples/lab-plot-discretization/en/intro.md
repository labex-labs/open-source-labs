# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to discretize continuous features using the KBinsDiscretizer class in Scikit-learn. Discretization is the process of transforming continuous features into discrete features by dividing the feature values into a set of bins. This can be useful when working with linear models that can only model linear relationships, or to reduce the complexity of decision trees.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

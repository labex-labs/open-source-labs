# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to perform univariate feature selection before running a support vector classifier (SVC) to improve the classification scores. We will use the iris dataset (4 features) and add 36 non-informative features. We will find that our model achieves the best performance when we select around 10% of features.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about GridSearchCV function in Scikit-Learn. GridSearchCV is a function that is used to search for the best hyperparameters for a given model. It is an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized by cross-validated grid-search over a parameter grid.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the implementation of Nearest Centroid Classification using Scikit-learn. Nearest Centroid Classification is a simple classification method that works by computing the centroid for each class and then classifying new data points based on which centroid they are closest to.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

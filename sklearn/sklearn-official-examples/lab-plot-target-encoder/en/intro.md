# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the performance of different categorical encoders on a wine review dataset. We will use the target column 'points' as the target variable to predict. We will compare the following encoders: TargetEncoder, OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, and dropping the category. We will also look at how to use the native categorical feature support in `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

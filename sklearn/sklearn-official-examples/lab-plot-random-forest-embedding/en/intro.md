# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use hashing feature transformation using totally random trees to map data to a high-dimensional, sparse representation that may be useful for classification. The mapping is entirely unsupervised and very efficient.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

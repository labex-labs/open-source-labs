# Introduction

In this lab, we will be using Python's Scikit-Learn library to perform Boosted Decision Tree Regression on a 1D sinusoidal dataset. We will compare the performance of a single Decision Tree Regressor with that of an AdaBoost Regressor with 300 Decision Tree Regressors as base learners.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

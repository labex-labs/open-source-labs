# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use a logistic regression algorithm to classify hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. We will use the SAGA algorithm to fit a multinomial logistic regression with L1 penalty on a subset of the MNIST digits classification task.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This is a step-by-step lab to demonstrate the usage of Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will be using the Iris Dataset, which contains information about the physical attributes of different types of iris flowers. The goal of this lab is to show how to use Scikit-learn to perform basic machine learning tasks such as data loading, data preprocessing, feature selection, and visualization.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

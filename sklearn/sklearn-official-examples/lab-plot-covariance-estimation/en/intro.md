# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to perform covariance estimation using regularization techniques such as shrinkage methods to reduce the variance of the estimator, as well as how to choose the bias-variance trade-off. We will compare three approaches to setting the regularization parameter.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

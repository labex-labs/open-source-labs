# Introduction

This lab demonstrates two approaches for feature selection: model-based and sequential feature selection. The goal is to select the most important features from a given dataset. We use the Diabetes dataset, consisting of 10 features collected from 442 diabetes patients.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

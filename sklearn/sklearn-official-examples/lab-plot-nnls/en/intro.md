# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about Non-negative least squares regression, a type of linear regression that constrains the regression coefficients to be non-negative. We will use Python's scikit-learn library to implement this algorithm and compare it to the classic linear regression.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

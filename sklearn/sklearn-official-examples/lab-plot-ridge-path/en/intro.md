# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Ridge Regression for estimating collinear coefficients of an estimator. Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that applies L2 regularization to the model.

In this example, we will generate a 10x10 Hilbert matrix and use Ridge Regression to estimate the coefficients of the matrix.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

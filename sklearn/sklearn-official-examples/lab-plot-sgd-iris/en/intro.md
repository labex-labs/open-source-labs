# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Scikit-Learn's SGDClassifier to implement a multi-class classification model on the famous iris dataset. We will plot the decision surface of the model on the dataset and visualize the hyperplanes corresponding to the three one-versus-all (OVA) classifiers.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

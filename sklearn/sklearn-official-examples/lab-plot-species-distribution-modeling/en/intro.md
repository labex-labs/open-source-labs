# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to model species' geographic distributions using machine learning. This is an important problem in conservation biology, as it helps us understand the distribution of different species and design effective conservation strategies. We will use a dataset of two South American mammals given past observations and 14 environmental variables. We will use the OneClassSVM algorithm from the scikit-learn library to model the geographic distribution of these two species.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

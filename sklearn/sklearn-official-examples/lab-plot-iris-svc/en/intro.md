# Introduction

The iris dataset is a classic dataset used for classification problems. In this lab, we will learn how to plot different SVM classifiers in the iris dataset using Python scikit-learn. We will compare different linear SVM classifiers on a 2D projection of the iris dataset.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

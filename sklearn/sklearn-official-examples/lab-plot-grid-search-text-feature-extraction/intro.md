# Introduction

The scikit-learn library provides tools for text feature extraction and evaluation. In this lab, we will use the 20newsgroups dataset to demonstrate how to extract features from text data, build a pipeline, and evaluate the performance of the model using hyperparameter tuning.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

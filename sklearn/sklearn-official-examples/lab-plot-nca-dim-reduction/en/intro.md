# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to apply Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) for dimensionality reduction using the scikit-learn library. This lab compares NCA with other (linear) dimensionality reduction methods applied on the Digits data set. The Digits dataset contains images of digits from 0 to 9 with approximately 180 samples of each class.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to compute the Lasso Path along the regularization parameter using the LARS algorithm on the diabetes dataset. The Lasso Path is a plot of the coefficients of a linear model as the L1 regularization parameter is increased. Each color represents a different feature of the coefficient vector, and this is displayed as a function of the regularization parameter.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

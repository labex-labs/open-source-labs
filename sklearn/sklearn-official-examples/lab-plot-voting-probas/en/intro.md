# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to plot class probabilities calculated by the VotingClassifier in Scikit-Learn. We will use three different classifiers, including LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, and RandomForestClassifier, and average their predicted probabilities using the VotingClassifier. We will then visualize the probability weighting by fitting each classifier on the training set and plot the predicted class probabilities for the first sample in the dataset.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will use spectral clustering to segment an image of Greek coins into multiple partly-homogeneous regions. Spectral clustering is a powerful technique that can be used to identify clusters in a dataset based on the similarity between their features. In this lab, we will use spectral clustering to segment an image by creating a graph from voxel-to-voxel difference on an image and then breaking the image into multiple partly-homogeneous regions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

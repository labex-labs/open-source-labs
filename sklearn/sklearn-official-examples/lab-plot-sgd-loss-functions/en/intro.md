# Introduction

In machine learning, loss functions are used to measure the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The `scikit-learn` library provides various convex loss functions for classification problems. In this lab, we will visualize and compare some of these loss functions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

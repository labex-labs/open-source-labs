# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classes that are unbalanced. We will first find the separating plane with a plain SVM and then plot (dashed) the separating hyperplane with automatic correction for unbalanced classes. We will use the `make_blobs` function to create two clusters of random points.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

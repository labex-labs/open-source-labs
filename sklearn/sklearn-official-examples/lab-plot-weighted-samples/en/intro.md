# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to plot a decision function of a weighted dataset in SVM. We will create a model that takes into account sample weights and another model that does not take into account sample weights. We will then compare the two models by plotting their decision functions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

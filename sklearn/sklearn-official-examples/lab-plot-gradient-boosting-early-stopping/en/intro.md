# Introduction

Gradient boosting is an ensemble technique where several weak learners (regression trees) are combined to yield a powerful single model, in an iterative fashion. Early stopping support in Gradient Boosting enables us to find the least number of iterations which is sufficient to build a model that generalizes well to unseen data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

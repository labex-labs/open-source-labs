# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the performance of different online solvers for the classification of handwritten digits. We will be using the scikit-learn library to load and preprocess the data, as well as to train and test the classifiers. The goal is to observe how different solvers perform under different proportions of training data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use permutation importance on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset using `permutation_importance` function from `sklearn.inspection`. The Random Forest Classifier is used to classify the data and compute its accuracy on a test set. We will also show how to handle multicollinearity in the features using hierarchical clustering.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

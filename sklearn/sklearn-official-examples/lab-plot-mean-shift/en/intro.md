# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of implementing the Mean-Shift Clustering Algorithm using the Scikit-learn library in Python. You will learn how to generate sample data, compute clustering with MeanShift, and plot the results.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

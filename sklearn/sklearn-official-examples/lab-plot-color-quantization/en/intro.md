# Introduction

Color quantization is a process of reducing the number of distinct colors used in an image while preserving its overall appearance. This is done by clustering similar colors together and representing them with a single color value. In this lab, we will use K-Means clustering algorithm to perform color quantization on an image of the Summer Palace in China.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

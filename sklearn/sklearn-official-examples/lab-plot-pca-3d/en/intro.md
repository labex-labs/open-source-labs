# Introduction

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to simplify data. It is a linear transformation technique that finds the most important features or patterns in the data. PCA is widely used in data analysis and machine learning for dimensionality reduction, data compression, and feature extraction. In this lab, we will use Python's scikit-learn library to perform PCA on a dataset and visualize the results.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

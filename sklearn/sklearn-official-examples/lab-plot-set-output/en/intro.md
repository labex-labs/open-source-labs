# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `set_output` API in Scikit-Learn to configure transformers to output pandas DataFrames. This feature is useful when working with heterogeneous data and pipelines in Scikit-Learn.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

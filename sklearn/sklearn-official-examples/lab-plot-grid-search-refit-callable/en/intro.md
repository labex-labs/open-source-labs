# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to balance model complexity and cross-validated score by finding a decent accuracy within 1 standard deviation of the best accuracy score while minimizing the number of PCA components. We will use the digits dataset from scikit-learn and a pipeline consisting of PCA and LinearSVC.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

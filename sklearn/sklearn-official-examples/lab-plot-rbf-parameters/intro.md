# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to tune the parameters of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel SVM. The `gamma` and `C` parameters of the RBF kernel are crucial for the performance of the SVM model. The goal is to choose the optimal values of these parameters that maximize the accuracy of the model.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

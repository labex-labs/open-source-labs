# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use hierarchical clustering to segment a 2D image. Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together. In the context of image segmentation, hierarchical clustering can be used to group pixels with similar color intensities together, which can be useful in identifying distinct regions or objects in an image.

We will use Python's scikit-learn library to perform hierarchical clustering on an image of coins.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

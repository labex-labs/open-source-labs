# Introduction

In machine learning, feature importance is a valuable tool for understanding which features have the most impact on the target variable. In this lab, we will compare two methods of calculating feature importance: impurity-based feature importance and permutation importance. We will use a random forest classifier on the Titanic dataset to illustrate the differences between the two methods.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

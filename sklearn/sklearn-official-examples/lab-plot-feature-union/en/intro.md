# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to concatenate multiple feature extraction methods using Python's scikit-learn library. We will use the `FeatureUnion` transformer to combine features obtained by PCA and univariate selection. Combining features using this transformer has the benefit that it allows cross-validation and grid searches over the whole process.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to generate a Gaussian mixture dataset. We will then fit a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the dataset and plot the density estimation of the mixture of Gaussians. GMMs can be used to model and estimate the probability distribution of a dataset.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of plotting partial dependence curves for multiple features. The partial dependence curves are used to analyze the effect of a feature on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model while holding all other features constant. This tutorial will demonstrate how to plot partial dependence curves for a decision tree and a multi-layer perceptron on the diabetes dataset.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

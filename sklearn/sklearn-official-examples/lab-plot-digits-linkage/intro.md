# Introduction

This lab illustrates various linkage options for agglomerative clustering on a 2D embedding of the digits dataset. The goal of this lab is to show how different linkage strategies behave and not to find good clusters for the digits. This is why the example works on a 2D embedding.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab will guide you through a step-by-step process of using the Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) algorithm to perform dimensionality reduction on the Iris dataset. IPCA is used when the dataset is too large to fit into memory and requires an incremental approach. We will compare the results of IPCA with the traditional PCA algorithm.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

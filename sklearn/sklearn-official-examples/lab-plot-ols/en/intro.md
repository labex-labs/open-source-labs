# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use linear regression to draw a straight line that best fits a dataset and how to calculate the coefficients, residual sum of squares, and coefficient of determination. We will be using the scikit-learn library to perform linear regression on the diabetes dataset.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

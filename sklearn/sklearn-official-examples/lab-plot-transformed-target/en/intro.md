# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the TransformedTargetRegressor from the scikit-learn library. We will apply it to two different datasets to observe the benefits of transforming the target values before training a linear regression model. We will use synthetic data and the Ames housing data set to illustrate the impact of transforming the target values.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

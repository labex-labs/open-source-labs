# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Scikit-learn Elastic-Net regression model to illustrate how the performance of an estimator on unseen data (test data) is not the same as the performance on training data. We will generate sample data, compute train and test errors, and plot the results functions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

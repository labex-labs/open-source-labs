# Introduction

Kernel Density Estimation is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn Python library to demonstrate the principles of Kernel Density Estimation in one dimension.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

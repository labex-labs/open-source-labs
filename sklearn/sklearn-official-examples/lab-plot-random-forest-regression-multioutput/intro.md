# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the use of the multi-output meta estimator to perform multi-output regression. A random forest regressor is used, which supports multi-output regression natively, so the results can be compared. The purpose of this lab is to show how to use the `MultiOutputRegressor` in scikit-learn to perform multi-output regression, and compare the results to a standard random forest regressor.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

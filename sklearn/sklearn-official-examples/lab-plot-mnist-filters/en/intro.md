# Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to create an MLPClassifier using Scikit-learn to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. We will also visualize the weights of the first layer of the MLP to gain insight into the learning behavior.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Gradient Boosting to build a predictive model for diabetes regression task. We will train the model on the diabetes dataset and obtain the results from `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` with least squares loss and 500 regression trees of depth 4.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

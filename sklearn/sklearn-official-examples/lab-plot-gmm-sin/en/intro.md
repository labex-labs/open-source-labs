# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm to fit a dataset that follows a noisy sine curve. We will use two different types of Gaussian Mixture Models, namely the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model with a Dirichlet process prior.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

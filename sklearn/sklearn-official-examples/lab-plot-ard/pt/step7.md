# Plotting Polynomial Regressions with Standard Errors of the Scores

The error bars represent one standard deviation of the predicted gaussian distribution of the query points. Notice that the ARD regression captures the ground truth the best when using the default parameters in both models, but further reducing the `lambda_init` hyperparameter of the Bayesian Ridge can reduce its bias. Finally, due to the intrinsic limitations of a polynomial regression, both models fail when extrapolating.

```python
ax = sns.scatterplot(
    data=full_data, x="input_feature", y="target", color="black", alpha=0.75
)
ax.plot(X_plot, y_plot, color="black", label="Ground Truth")
ax.plot(X_plot, y_brr, color="red", label="BayesianRidge with polynomial features")
ax.plot(X_plot, y_ard, color="navy", label="ARD with polynomial features")
ax.fill_between(
    X_plot.ravel(),
    y_ard - y_ard_std,
    y_ard + y_ard_std,
    color="navy",
    alpha=0.3,
)
ax.fill_between(
    X_plot.ravel(),
    y_brr - y_brr_std,
    y_brr + y_brr_std,
    color="red",
    alpha=0.3,
)
ax.legend()
_ = ax.set_title("Polynomial fit of a non-linear feature")
```

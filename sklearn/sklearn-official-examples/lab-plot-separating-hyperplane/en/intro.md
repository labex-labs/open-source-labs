# Introduction

In this lab, we will use scikit-learn to create a two-class separable dataset and plot the maximum margin separating hyperplane using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the best boundary or hyperplane that separates the data into different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

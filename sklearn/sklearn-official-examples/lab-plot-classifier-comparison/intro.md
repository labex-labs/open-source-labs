# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare several classifiers in Scikit-Learn on synthetic datasets. The purpose of this lab is to illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. We will preprocess the datasets, split them into training and test parts, and plot the datasets. We will then iterate over classifiers, fit the classifiers on the training data, plot the decision boundaries, and plot the testing data. Finally, we will display the classification accuracy on the test set.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

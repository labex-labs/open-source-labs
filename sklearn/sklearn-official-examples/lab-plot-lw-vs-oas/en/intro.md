# Introduction

Covariance estimation is an important task in statistical analysis. In this lab, we will compare two methods of covariance estimation: Ledoit-Wolf and OAS. We will use Gaussian distributed data to compare the estimated MSE of these two methods.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

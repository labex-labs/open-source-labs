# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about selecting the best hyperparameter alpha for Lasso regression models. Two approaches will be discussed: (1) selecting the optimal value of alpha by only using the training set and some information criterion, and (2) selecting the best hyperparameter using cross-validation. We will use the diabetes dataset in this example.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `TargetEncoder` class from the Scikit-learn library. Target encoding is a technique used to transform categorical data into numerical data that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. The `TargetEncoder` replaces each category of a categorical feature with the mean of the target variable for that category. This method is useful in cases where there is a strong relationship between the categorical feature and the target.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

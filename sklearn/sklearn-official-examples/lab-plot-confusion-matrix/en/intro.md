# Introduction

The confusion matrix is a tool for evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. It is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted class labels with actual class labels. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the scikit-learn library to generate a confusion matrix and visualize its results.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to perform semi-supervised learning using the Label Spreading algorithm. We will use a subset of the handwritten digit dataset and only 40 of these samples will be labeled. We will then use Label Spreading to predict the remaining 300 samples.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

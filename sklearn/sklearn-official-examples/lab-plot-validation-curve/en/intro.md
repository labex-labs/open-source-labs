# Introduction

In machine learning, validation curves are used to determine the training and validation scores of a classifier for different hyperparameter values. This can help in selecting the best hyperparameters for a model. In this lab, we will use scikit-learn to plot validation curves for a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about Lasso and Elastic Net, which are techniques used for linear regression and implemented using a coordinate descent. We will learn how to compute regularization paths using the Lasso and Elastic Net, and how to display the results using matplotlib.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

Manifold learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with learning the underlying structure of high-dimensional data. In this lab, we will apply different manifold learning techniques on a spherical dataset. We will use dimensionality reduction to gain some intuition regarding the manifold learning methods.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

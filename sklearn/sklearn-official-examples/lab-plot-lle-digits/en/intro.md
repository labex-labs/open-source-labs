# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore various manifold embedding techniques on the digits dataset. We will use different techniques to embed the digits dataset, plot the projection of the original data onto each embedding, and compare the results obtained from different embedding methods.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

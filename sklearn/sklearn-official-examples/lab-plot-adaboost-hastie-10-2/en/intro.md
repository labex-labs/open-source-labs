# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the difference in performance between the discrete SAMME boosting algorithm and the real SAMME.R boosting algorithm. Both algorithms are evaluated on a binary classification task where the target Y is a non-linear function of 10 input features. The lab is based on Figure 10.2 from Hastie et al 2009.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

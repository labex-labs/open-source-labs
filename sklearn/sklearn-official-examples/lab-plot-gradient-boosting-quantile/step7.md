# Tune the Hyper-parameters of the Quantile Regressors

We will tune the hyper-parameters of a new regressor of the 5th percentile by selecting the best model parameters by cross-validation on the pinball loss with alpha=0.05. We will then tune the hyper-parameters for the 95th percentile regressor.

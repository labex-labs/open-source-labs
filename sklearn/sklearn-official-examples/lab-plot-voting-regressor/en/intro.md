# Introduction

In this lab, we will use a Voting Regressor to predict the progression of diabetes in patients. We will use three different regressors to predict the data: Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression. Then the above 3 regressors will be used for the Voting Regressor. Finally, we will plot the predictions made by all models for comparison.

We will work with the diabetes dataset which consists of 10 features collected from a cohort of diabetes patients. The target is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

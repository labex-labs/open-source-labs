# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use the scikit-learn API to process a large dataset of faces and learn a set of 20 x 20 image patches that represent faces. The key aspect of this lab is the use of online learning, where we load and process images one at a time and extract 50 random patches from each image. We accumulate 500 patches (from 10 images) and then run the online KMeans object, MiniBatchKMeans' partial_fit method.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

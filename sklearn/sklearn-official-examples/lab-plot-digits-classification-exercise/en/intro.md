# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to use classification techniques on the Digits dataset using scikit-learn. In this lab, we will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split the dataset into training and testing sets, and then use two different classification techniques (K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression) to classify the digits. Finally, we will compare the accuracy of both techniques.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

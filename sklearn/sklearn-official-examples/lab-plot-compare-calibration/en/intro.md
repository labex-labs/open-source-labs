# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the calibration of four different models: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Linear SVM. Calibration curves will be plotted for each model, which show the relationship between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. This is important because well-calibrated models produce probabilities that are accurate and reliable.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the sparsity of solutions when L1, L2, and Elastic-Net penalty are used for different values of C. We will use logistic regression to classify 8x8 images of digits into two classes: 0-4 against 5-9. We will visualize the coefficients of the models for varying C.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

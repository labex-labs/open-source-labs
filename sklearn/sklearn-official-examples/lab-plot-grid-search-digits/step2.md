# Define Grid-Search Strategy

We will define a function to be passed to the `refit` parameter of the `GridSearchCV` instance. It will implement the custom strategy to select the best candidate from the `cv_results_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV`. Once the candidate is selected, it is automatically refitted by the `GridSearchCV` instance.

Here, the strategy is to short-list the models which are the best in terms of precision and recall. From the selected models, we finally select the fastest model at predicting. Notice that these custom choices are completely arbitrary.

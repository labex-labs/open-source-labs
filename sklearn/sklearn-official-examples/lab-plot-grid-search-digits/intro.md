# Introduction

This lab shows how to perform hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation using the scikit-learn library. The aim is to classify handwritten digits images using a binary classification for easier understanding: identifying whether a digit is 8 or not. The dataset used is the digits dataset. The performance of the selected hyper-parameters and trained model is then measured on a dedicated evaluation set that was not used during the model selection step.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

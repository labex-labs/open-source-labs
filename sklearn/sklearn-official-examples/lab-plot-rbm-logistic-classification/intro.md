# Introduction

This lab focuses on the use of Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for classification of handwritten digits. The RBM feature extractor is combined with a logistic regression classifier to predict the digits. The dataset used is a greyscale image data where pixel values can be interpreted as degrees of blackness on a white background.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

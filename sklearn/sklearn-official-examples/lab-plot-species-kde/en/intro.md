# Introduction

This lab demonstrates an example of a neighbors-based query (in particular a kernel density estimate) on geospatial data, using a Ball Tree built upon the Haversine distance metric -- i.e. distances over points in latitude/longitude. The dataset is provided by Phillips et. al. (2006). The example uses the basemap library to plot the coastlines and national boundaries of South America.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

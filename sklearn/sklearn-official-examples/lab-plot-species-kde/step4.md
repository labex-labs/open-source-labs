# Construct Grids

We will now construct the map grid from the batch object. We will use the `construct_grids` function to achieve this.

```python
def construct_grids(batch):
    """Construct the map grid from the batch object

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch : Batch object
        The object returned by :func:`fetch_species_distributions`

    Returns
    -------
    (xgrid, ygrid) : 1-D arrays
        The grid corresponding to the values in batch.coverages
    """
    # x,y coordinates for corner cells
    xmin = batch.x_left_lower_corner + batch.grid_size
    xmax = xmin + (batch.Nx * batch.grid_size)
    ymin = batch.y_left_lower_corner + batch.grid_size
    ymax = ymin + (batch.Ny * batch.grid_size)

    # x coordinates of the grid cells
    xgrid = np.arange(xmin, xmax, batch.grid_size)
    # y coordinates of the grid cells
    ygrid = np.arange(ymin, ymax, batch.grid_size)

    return (xgrid, ygrid)

# Call the function and store the results in xgrid and ygrid
xgrid, ygrid = construct_grids(data)
```

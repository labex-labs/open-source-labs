# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to train a random forest on the Olivetti Faces dataset and evaluate the impurity-based feature importance. We will use the feature importances to create a heat map of the pixel importances. We will also parallelize the construction and computation of the predictions within multiple jobs.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

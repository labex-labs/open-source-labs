# Introduction

In this lab, we will use several unsupervised learning techniques to extract the structure of the stock market from variations in historical quotes. We will use the daily variation in quote price to find which quotes are correlated conditionally on the others. Then, we will use clustering to group together quotes that behave similarly. Finally, we will lay out the different symbols on a 2D canvas using manifold techniques to retrieve 2D embedding.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to transform features into a higher dimensional, sparse space using an ensemble of trees. We will then train a linear model on these features. We will use different types of ensemble methods including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and compare their performance.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Python scikit-learn library to explore the difference between Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge Regression. We will examine how these two methods of linear regression cope with noise in the data, and how they differ in their predictions.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

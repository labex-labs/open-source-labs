# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the use of OPTICS clustering algorithm using scikit-learn library. OPTICS is an acronym for Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure. It is a density-based clustering algorithm that finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. In this lab, we will generate sample data, plot the reachability plot, and use DBSCAN to cluster the data.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

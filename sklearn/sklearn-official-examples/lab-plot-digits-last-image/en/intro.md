# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the scikit-learn digits dataset. This dataset consists of 1797 8x8 pixel images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0-9. Our goal is to analyze this dataset and understand how we can utilize it to classify handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the reconstruction of a sparse image from a set of parallel projections using compressive sensing. Compressive sensing is a technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing signals that are sparse in some domain. In this case, we are interested in reconstructing a 2D image from a small number of projections acquired along different angles. We will compare the performance of L1 and L2 penalization methods for this task.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

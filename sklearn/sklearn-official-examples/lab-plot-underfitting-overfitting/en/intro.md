# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the problems of underfitting and overfitting in machine learning, and how we can use linear regression with polynomial features to approximate nonlinear functions. We will use scikit-learn to generate data, fit models, and evaluate model performance.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

# Introduction

This lab demonstrates an active learning technique to learn handwritten digits using label propagation. The Label Propagation is a semi-supervised learning method that uses a graph-based approach to propagate labels across data points. Active learning is a process that allows us to iteratively select data points to label, and use these labeled points to retrain the model.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access [Jupyter Notebook](https://support.labex.io/en/labex-vm/jupyter) for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.

```

## Requirements

- To install the project dependencies, use the following command:

  ```

- Please complete this challenge in the `src/App.js` file.
- The `toggleVisible` function is defined to check the scroll position and update the showBackToTopBtn state accordingly.
- The `useEffect` hook is used to add an event listener to the window's scroll event, which triggers the toggleVisible function.
- The `scrollToTop` function is defined to scroll the window to the top when the back-to-top button is clicked.

## Example

Once you have completed the code, run it with the following command:

```bash
npm start

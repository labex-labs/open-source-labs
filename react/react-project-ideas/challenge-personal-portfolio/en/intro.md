# Introduction

In this tutorial we will build a responsive Portfolio Project in React from scratch. This tutorial will teach you how you can develop your own modern 2023 ready personal portfolio website using reactjs, html & css.
The development process is simple and we won't do any API calls. Content/Text for this website will be hardcoded in your components.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a <span class="text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">intermediate</span> level challenge with a <span class="text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">58.33%</span> pass rate.

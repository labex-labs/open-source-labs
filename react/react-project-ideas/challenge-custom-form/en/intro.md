# Introduction

In this challenge you will be developing a reusable custom form aka submit form in React with functional component in which you can add as much input fields and buttons as you want by sending them as props. You can use that SINGLE component in your future projects too to have login form, registration form or a data creation/updation form for any CRUD functionality.

This form does not add input fields dynamically but it has capability to create multiple fields by sending them as props. So, if you have big project which can have multiple forms, you can create ONE SINGLE CUSTOM FORM COMPONENT and call that wherever you want.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a <span class="text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">intermediate</span> level challenge with a <span class="text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">54.55%</span> pass rate.

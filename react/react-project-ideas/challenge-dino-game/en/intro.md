This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a <span class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">intermediate</span> level challenge with a <span class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">60%</span> pass rate.

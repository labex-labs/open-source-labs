# Introduction

In this challenge we will develop a react drag and drop similar to JIRA board without any external library.
You will learn how to make a html element draggable and how to make a div to catch that draggable element.
JS events used in this challenge are onDragOver, onDrop, onDragStart.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

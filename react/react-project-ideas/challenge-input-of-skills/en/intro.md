# Introduction

In this challenge we will develop react tag input component which can add tags without any external library.
Only with just one component you can have an input box with the capability to input tags or keywords.
In input of tags component, there will be only one state which will carry all the user inputs with the help of onKeyUp JavaScript event.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 border-t border-l-2 border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 pt-2 pl-4">
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution.

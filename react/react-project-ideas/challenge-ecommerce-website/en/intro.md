# Introduction

In this tutorial we will develop a shopping website aka Reactjs Ecommerce (with open source code) project using Reactjs Context API. This tutorial will teach you to develop an ecommerce website with basic functionality i.e. show products, add to cart, review and checkout and place & view orders.
For routing we will use 'react-router-dom' npm package.

This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">beginner</span> level challenge with a <span class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">82%</span> pass rate.

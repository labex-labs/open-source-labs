# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a password input field with a toggle button that allows users to show or hide their password. This will be done using the `useState()` hook in React. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manage state in React and how to create a simple yet useful component for user interaction.

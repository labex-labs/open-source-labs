# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create an uncontrolled input field using React. An uncontrolled input field is a simple and flexible way to capture user input without managing the value state in the parent component. We will use a callback function to inform the parent about value updates, making it easy to integrate with other components and APIs.

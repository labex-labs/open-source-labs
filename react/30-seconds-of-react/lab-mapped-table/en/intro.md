# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a dynamic table component in React using an array of objects and a list of property names. The component will use various JavaScript array methods such as `Object.keys()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`, `Array.prototype.includes()`, and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to filter the data and render the table with the specified properties. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to render dynamic tables in React.
